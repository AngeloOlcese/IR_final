Thanks for your patience as we compiled this list. Please let us know if you have any questions.


Sincerely,

The GRO

.M
Hey Gents,

It's with much regret that I need to inform you of the other major
leadership change heading into your 2019 season: I am formally resigning
from being a captain for this upcoming season.

Unfortunately, non-surgical treatment of my hip injury has not gone
according to plan. To actually fix the hip, I plan to take the entire
season off, get surgery in early August, and return to playing for real in
winter or spring of 2020 so that I have 6-8 full months to recover without
pressure or temptation to play. Hopefully, I can come hang out a bit after
I'm mobile again post-op.

I wish more than you know that my hip worked, that I didn't need surgery,
that I could ball with everyone this summer, that I could captain this
year, etc, but that's not the hand I've been dealt right now.

I'll be cheering you on from afar and hope to see you all soon,
Jordan

.M
GShomies,

I hope everyone is doing well and enjoying their offseason. It's been
pretty awesome to see some of you over the last few months. I am super
excited to hit the fields at the first tryout with you all and start the
2019 GSU season.

This email is to make you aware of some of the leadership changes that are
occurring for the 2019 GSU season and to also serve as an opportunity if
anyone has any questions to send them captains and coaches way.

Going forward, we will be moving on from Eileen as our coach for GSU. She
has brought an immense amount of knowledge and has taught us a lot as a
team and for that we can never thank her enough for her contributions to
the program. Grover will be stepping up in the head coach position, and we
are very excited about this move.

We recognize that this brings up a lot of questions and if you have any,
please do not hesitate to reach out and we will do our best to answer them.

That being said, we are extremely excited about the upcoming season. Our
goals to make Nationals has not changed and there are some changes coming
our way that we feel is going to best put us in a position to succeed.

Continue to put in the work off the field, the GPP workouts have paid huge
dividends (I'm sure Tristan can speak to that) so there's still time to get
on board that.

Tryouts start in 2 weeks! Keep spreading around tryout form (
https://forms.gle/yF1nh6pG4s2D7nwm8) and get every one to come out. Very
excited to see you all!


Best,

.M
Dear grads,

Each year the GRO issues the Rachel S. Core award to a graduate student(s), for their outstanding service to the graduate student body.  This year we had many qualified nominees, but ultimately the award was given to co-nominees Heba Islam and Marios Falaris, who spent countless hours raising concerns and bringing attention to the #JHToo movement, transforming the ways in which we talk about  and address gendered violence on campus.  Additionally, an honorable mention was given to Alexandra Sneider, co-president of Women of Whiting (WoW) for her work in promoting and supporting women in STEM on our campuses.

Again another round of congratulations to our winners!

Best,

GRO

.S GPSA week Wine & Cheese Tonight
.M
All,

Join us tonight at 7pm for a wine & cheese tasting/pairing in the Gilman
Atrium. Come and try an assortment of wines, cheeses, and to socialize with
your fellow grad students. Feel free to dress up a bit and enjoy the
slightly fancier theme! We will have a limited supply of mocktails for
those grad students who do not drink or are DD-ing. Event will run either
until 10pm or while supplies last.

Please bring your Hopkins ID and a government issued ID with a birthday.
Please make sure to eat before this event as cheese supplies will be
limited.

Dear Graduate Colleagues,

This Wednesday at 6pm at the Wyman Park Dell the Hopkins Coalition Against ICE<https://www.facebook.com/ICEOutJHU/> and the Students Against Private Police<https://www.facebook.com/NOPRIVATEPOLICEJHU/> are hosting a Rally and a March to demand an end to the University's contracts with ICE and to march against the proposed Hopkins Private Police, which was just signed into law.

You can find more event information and RSVP HERE<https://www.facebook.com/events/384039095510733/>.

If you feel strongly about these issues and want to make your voice heard, please consider attending. Thank you!

In Solidarity,

Looks like we should be good to go for a round robin on the baseball fields at 2pm on sunday!  Waiting for final confirmation from UMBC B and Goucher.  If you have any questions, send them my way (but I likely won't respond until shabbat is over).  I'm assuming everyone who RSVP'd as yes to the tournament is still available.  Please let me know if not.

All,

  *

A new committee has been formed for graduate students to be involved in the planning of the new Hopkins Student center, called the Hopkins Student Center Advisory Committee (HSCAC), and it needs your help!


The HSCAC is comprised of faculty, staff and student representatives from across the University. Eight seats on the committee are reserved for students; two of these 8 spots are reserved for members of Homewood student government (1 SGA, 1 GRO). Undergraduate and graduate students from any Hopkins school are encouraged to apply. Students selected to serve on the committee will play a key role in development and implementation of a broad student engagement strategy.


All interested students should complete the online application below by Monday, April 8. Students must be enrolled during the 2019-20 academic year as well as have availability for consultation during the summer months to be eligible to serve on the advisory committee. The committee membership will be selected by the Vice Provost for Student Affairs, Kevin Shollenberger, and the Chair of the Hopkins Student Center Advisory Committee, Alanna W. Shanahan. Full committee membership will be released prior to the end of April and the first meeting will take place shortly thereafter and continue throughout the project’s development


Apply here: https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/viceprovost/university-student-leadership-engagement-opportunities

Further information can be found at the following link:  https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/viceprovost/student-center/

All the best,
The GRO

.S Advising Process Survey
.D Tue, 12 Mar 2019 02:58:30 +0000
.M
Dear Homewood Graduate Students,

We are working on an effort to improve the Advising process in regards to progressing towards your graduate degree. Every department and program operates a little differently. So, to start, we would like to collect information from all of you about how your program is structured.

Below is a link to a very short survey (15 questions, ~3 minutes to complete), that we ask you to complete. The survey is anonymous, but your responses will help us understand the graduate student experience across KSAS and WSE, and the many programs and departments within each school.


Take the short anonymous survey here: https://jhukrieger.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1SPfmaP6iSITibb



Our thanks in advance! Please reach out to us with any questions or comments.

Your Homewood Graduate Board Student Representatives,

Tara & Santosh

.S Early Season Planning
.M
Sup Snakes,

Good to see many of y'all in Philly last weekend! Leadership is pumped for
the beginning of the season, which is a just a few short months down the
road.

We're going to break down a number of things for you in this email:
1) Finalized tryout schedule
2) More preliminary information on tournaments we are considering
3) Discussing individual roles for the upcoming season
4) Giving you an interest form to fill out

*1) GSU Tryout Schedule*
May 11 - Open Tryout
May 12 - Open Tryout
May 18 - Invite Tryout
May 19 - Invite Tryout
May 25 - Off
May 26 - Off
June 1 - NY Warm Up (tryout tournament, invite only)
June 2 - NY Warm Up (tryout tournament, invite only)

If you're intending to play the 2019 season, we expect to see you at our
tryouts. As we discussed at our offseason meeting, we want these tryouts to
be high level early season reps, so we expect you all to be there. Please
reach out to leadership if you have any questions.

*2) Preliminary Tournament Information*
In addition to NY Warm-Up, we are considering the below tournaments. We
will finalize our tournament schedule closer to the season, weighing
playing opportunities, cost, and level of competition.

June 22-23 Pittsburg or Boston Invite
Philly Select (Date TBD)
July 27-28 Select Flight Invite, Columbus Ohio
Chesapeake (Date TBD)
September 7-8 Sectionals
September 22-23 Regionals

*3) Discussing Roles for the season*
The captains and coaches are looking to start *open conversations* with
returners about the roles we envision them playing for the upcoming season.
If you are returning, you should expect an email from leadership over the
coming weeks laying out specifics (don't freak if you haven't gotten one
yet). This should help you target your preparation over the remainder of
the off-season and hopefully get you hyped to see the field in a couple
short months! We hope you can think a bit about what we envision for you,
and that these emails will be the start of a continuing conversation with
input from both sides about what will work best. As a bonus, to facilitate
you thinking about how that new role fits into our broader system, Grover
has put together an extensive playbook that will be on our google drive and
we will use as a reference throughout the season (coming soon).

*4) Interest Form *
Please spread the interest form around on twitter, facebook, reddit, and
send it on to anyone who may be interested in GSU 2019.
Here's the link
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdaLl2_0uGGgQl5HWF_OewPKKmqyb0GlmiY1uwihgsqsDecPg/viewform?usp=sf_link>
:
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdaLl2_0uGGgQl5HWF_OewPKKmqyb0GlmiY1uwihgsqsDecPg/viewform?usp=sf_link
Fill it out if you feel like it. Future tryout-specific communication will
go to this email list and the one compiled from the interest form
submissions.


This off season has been super exciting, from y'all getting jacked up on
GPP, to Conor being Jesse's best man, to playbooks, to Kwang being an axe
throwing automaton champion. Get stoked to hit the field soon!
Much Love,
Caps + Coaches

Hey Friends!


Sorry for the delay -- turns out being a PhD student occasionally gets very busy.


We have decided to go to two tournaments with FZ.  The first is at GTown on the 16-17th of march and the second @ GMU on march 30-31.  We are going to be skipping sectionals this year as its not worth the financial burden of getting properly registered as such.


https://goo.gl/forms/J23zTteqW6bkl0Nt2


Fill this out ASAP so we can get logistics going.  Upperclassmen on FZ, get your friends who might not be reading the emails/groupme to fill it out and come.


For people attending HT over spring break, going to to the tournament at GTown will be nice an easy as miultiple folks will be driving down after the tournament.


Lets go friends!

.S Relationships Policy Commenting Period
.D Wed, 27 Feb 2019 00:21:54 +0000
.M
Hello Grads,

The vice Provost for Faculty Affairs, in coordination with the office of the Vice Provost for Institutional Equity have drafted a new policy that would regulate personal relationships between members of the university community.  This draft policy has not yet been finalized, but may affect many members of our community if is adopted.  Therefore, we strongly urge you to review the brief (9 pages) draft document,<https://policies.jhu.edu/userfiles/32371/upload/Personal_Relationships.pdf> and leave comments, questions or concerns in the comment submission field<https://policies.jhu.edu/?event=under-review&utm_source=JHU+Broadcast+Messages+-+Synced+List&utm_campaign=74a5bc9d84-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_01_23_05_15&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_9cf4956bf9-74a5bc9d84-69748637&mc_cid=74a5bc9d84&mc_eid=4bf5e4efff>. [NB: you will be required to login with your JHED to leave a comment here; if you wish to make an anonymous comment please contact Elliot Wainwright (ewainwr2@jhu.edu) or Karen Cl
 othier (kclothi1@jhu.edu).  The comment period ends 15 March.

The intent of the document (as presented to the members of the Ph.D. Student Advisory Committee on which Elliot and Karen sit) is to protect members of the community in lower power positions, and prevent from the potential of abuse or special treatment that may arise from relationships between, e.g. a graduate student and an undergrad or a grad student and a faculty or staff member.

Please help the administration create a policy that will serve this purpose for our community by provided examples (real or hypothetical) that would pose a challenge - either in spirit or of enforcement - to this draft policy.

Here are some important details about this draft policy to consider:

  *   The committee that draft this policy, after looking at how peer institutions currently handle similar issues, have laid out 4 possible options regarding how lenient this policy would be with regards to relationships between graduate students and faculty.  These options are written out on the bottom on page 4 and continue on the top of page 5.  Please read this options carefully and consider how each option would affect you or other members of your department.
  *   carefully consider the reporting mechanisms described in section 4, page 7 - consider how you would feel navigating that reporting structure.  Who would you report to?  Would you feel comfortable, safe, or confident that your case would be appropriately handled by that person?  If not why, and what alternative would you propose?
  *   On page 8, there are no exemptions or exceptions currently listed - should there be?
  *   Also, on page 8, this draft proposes that the Office of Institutional Equity (OIE) will investigate alleged violations and enforce this policy - what do you think about that?

Thank you for taking the time to actively shape a positive work environment for yourself and your peers.

The deadline to submit applications for the last lottery is this Friday, March 1st, 2019. The incredible turnout this year has persuaded us at the GRO to pursue more travel funding opportunities this upcoming year, so stay tuned...

DETAILS & INFO:
1. In order to apply, fill out the google form here<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBp74Mg59kYPVOZHxyyJH1Da4Aws-h8bf68faPfzDzqbGtkA/viewform?usp=sf_link> (doesn't take more than 15 min)

Whatitdo brethren,

Coming off the HYPE of Easterns Qualifier, we get to look forward to the rest of the season. In order to show everybody who Dangerzone is and what we have, we have to be able to go to tournaments, pay for transportation, and pay for hotels (and other expenses that may come up along the way). This means that we’re charging spring dues. The due prices are:

DZ Players: $125.00
FZ Players: $50.00

Please Venmo @Dangerzone-Ultimate by Friday, March 1st. Talk to TShade or Alex Lindsay if you have any concerns or questions regarding the payment. I can’t wait to see what is in store for this season. DZRising.

Let’s get this bread,

Alexander Lindsay, Maryland EMT-B

.S Upcoming Events
.M
Hey GSU,

*Rough Early Season Schedule*
We've fielded a couple questions about tryout and early season dates over
the last few weeks, so we wanted to give you a rough idea of when we expect
events to be. As we get access to full AUDL practice schedules and have a
better idea of who is playing with which teams, we'll set exact dates for
these events and notify everyone.

*Open Tryouts*: One of May 4-5, 11-12, or 18-19 (After college regionals,
before college nationals)

*New York Warm Up*: June 1-2 (unsanctioned tournament/closed tryouts)

*More closed tryouts/practices*: June 8-9 or June 15-16

We'll also keep you in the loop as we get closer to other early season
events we've talked about such as *Boston Invite *(June 22-23) and the
*Pittsburgh
unsanctioned tournament* (TBD)

*Philly Outing*
We've been talking about getting a Philly outing going for our central
NJ/PA folks. Please fill out this survey
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIcGFCxYgzUqE0_JRUX6NKiuAaC_912cgmdgMVG6IXGts2cQ/viewform?usp=sf_link>indicating
which weekend nights work so we can pick a day. We're thinking of doing
some axe throwing, but open to other suggestions.

Also go do *emo bowling* with Jake in Brooklyn on Feb 23 if that's your
style.

*Beach Mini @ Grover's*
keep your heads up for a beach day or weekend with some fris and a dope
pinball museum in late march or April

One last thing: friendly reminder to log those GPP workouts!

Let us know if you have any questions,
Caps

Hello Friends,


We are trying to finalize the schedule for FZ this semester and there are a couple choices we can make.  To ensure that we have the number to bring to these tournaments, I'm sending out this survey.


https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1RD_ExTb3OsBgDcU1dPZ2WqufktG1oqXuLyAvGuvhIeI/edit



Please fill it out ASAP so we can send in bids.


@upperclassman who aren't on DZ, please fill this out. Even if you have not been to practice in a while, thats totally fine.  And talk to other upperclassman in your year to gauge their interest.  There are a fair number of folks who couldn't commit to the time required to practice - you are still invited to these tournaments.

.S Free Menstrual Access on the Campus: Please Respond!
.D Mon, 28 Jan 2019 18:39:08 +0000
.M
Dear Grads,


Welcome back! As we are all set to embark on this new semester, it is each of our responsibility to create an empowered environment for women. In order to raise awareness about the heavily neglected subject of menstrual health and sanitation that women experiencing financial difficulties often face, Wings<http://idealab.jhu.edu/challenge/2018-hopkins-eco-smart-acorn-grants/ideas/wings-supporting-sustainable-menstrual-health-in-homeless-women/> (JHU Student Organization) is beginning an initiative to provide free menstrual products in bathrooms on the Homewood campus. They are holding a pre-climate assessment survey<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2qmVDta55cBheI6ZB74zEQpF29rdHaB0fzj43W0nj7eW5Rw/viewform> to gather student and faculty thoughts on the matter. Currently, graduate students are the most underrepresented in the survey responses. The survey should take less than 5 minutes to fill and hence please endeavor to complete it! You can take the survey here<https:
 //docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2qmVDta55cBheI6ZB74zEQpF29rdHaB0fzj43W0nj7eW5Rw/viewform> (If you choose to enter your email address, you will be automatically entered into a raffle for free dinner of your choosing on St. Paul Street).

.S Arts outing opportunity for doctoral students at JHU
.D Tue, 15 Jan 2019 15:53:50 +0000
.M
Dear all:



You may or may not know that there has been a program in place for a while for undergraduates from the Homewood schools to attend various arts performances in Baltimore, along with JHU faculty, and then have dinner afterwards, thanks to contributions from the parents’ fund.



This year, we are pleased to announce that, on a trial basis, we have added two arts outings for doctoral students!  This is a chance for students to get out of their studies for an afternoon and meet some colleagues from different parts of the university.  And of course to experience the arts :)  and support arts organizations in Baltimore.  Please sign up if you’d like to  go (I think they see how many students want to go and then do a lottery) and also please distribute this announcement to other doctoral students in your orbit.  The costs of the tickets and dinner are covered at no cost to the student and accompanying faculty.  Feel free to encourage any favorite faculty to sign up to go, too, as there are 2 slots for each outing for faculty.   I do think that if the response is really high, there would be consideration next year of adding more performances.



The relevant link to distribute is here:  https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/homewoodarts/hopart/   The two shows open to doctoral students are “Fun Home” at Center Stage (Saturday matinee February 23) and “Diary of Anne Frank” at Chesapeake Shakespeare Company (Sunday matinee May 5).  The outing will also include a dinner out after the performance with 2 JHU faculty.  The link above includes a place to sign up.  Of course feel free to send any questions my way.

.S HIGH TIDE 2019
.M
What it do fellas,

HIGH TIDE
Come spend your spring break with your only friends in beautiful N Myrtle
Beach, SC!

What?
For those of you who are still unaware, high tide is the most wonderful
time of the year. A time to truly bond with your ultimate comrades, and do
all kinds of fun activities including (but not limited to) shaking, baking,
dancing, prancing, creating hullabaloo, and developing intricate secret
handshakes. It’s like Christmas in March, and also way better than
Christmas!

WHERE?
The LOVELY city of North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina

WHEN?
Sunday, March 17 – Friday, March 22

HOW MUCH?
Calculations are still in the works, but the per-person cost will likely be
~$350 (but will go down if more people sign up so peer pressure your
friends!!!!)
Your money goes towards transportation to SC, a DOPE beach house,
tournament cost, food, and beverages for the whole week! By far the best
value you get for any spring break trip!
Bfast and dinner will be prepared at the house by our wonderful team chefs.
Food will be plentiful. Drink will be (more) plentiful ;)

LOGISTICS
Both teams will have a tournament the first weekend of spring break. DZ's
tournament is an overnighter so they will be leaving Friday evening. FZ
will drive back and forth to their tournament on Saturday March 16, and
then on Sunday when they’re done they’ll head straight down to good ole
Myrtle.

EVERYONE will leave on Friday morning March 22 to head back to JHU.

ACTIVITIES!!!
FZ will be in the #official High Tide tournament from the 19th–21nd if we
get enough interest! Team from all over the US will be there, so it’s a
great chance to improve and, of course, have fun!!!!

On the 18th there will be the official High Tide hat tournament!

DZ will practice ultimate during the day so they can practice other things
at night ;)

Fill out this form:
https://goo.gl/forms/DEzSLLBkY3CpIAI53

Reach out to (571) 328-1318‬ if you have any questions!

Best,
Lukey pie & Matty Sklar

.S GSU 2019
.M
Lads,

The captains and coaches met earlier today to talk about the upcoming
season and we wanted to share some of the high level items that were
discussed and what changes you have to look forward to this upcoming
season. We're super excited and if you have any questions please reach out
to one of the captains or coaches.

*Game Point Performance / Workouts - *As a team, we are going forward with
GPP. This is the last call for anyone who wants to join or knows anyone
interested in GSU who would be interested in joining the program. Sticking
to GPP programming throughout the offseason and into the season will make
us better ultimate players, more explosive athletes, and help us stay
healthy. There's lots of room for personalization within the GPP program,
and the workouts are tailored to be quick and efficient. Also, it'll give
you all the opportunities you could ever want for more workout selfies
(which we hope you'll continue to post to pump up your teammates and
document your progress)!

*Division of Duties - * We are fortunate that we have two super talented
coaches. This year we are going to have them split responsibilities during
tournaments so that they can each focus on their strengths. Eileen will
handle in game strategy and adjustments, while Grover will handle all line
calling. Captains will help support the coaches with both of these jobs,
and we are committed to fostering open culture of communication between
players, captains, and coaches about how the team should be operating at
all times.

*Practices  / Schedule  - * We are going to continue to update the GSU
google calendar (you should have access from last year) with the locations
and times of practices. In addition, we will be sending out scheduling
emails on a monthly or biweekly basis to periodically describe our schedule
over the next couple weeks. Furthermore, closer to the actual date of
practices, we plan to distribute practice plans via email so you can come
to practice knowing what we plan to work on that day.

*Film - *We want to build on the film review habits that we began to
develop as a group last year. We plan to do this by continuing to
distribute video of our practices and games, as well as maintaining open
spreadsheets where we can all comment on recent film with feedback for our
teammates. Coaches and captains plan to review all the provided feedback
periodically to ensure we're all pulling in the same direction. This also
comes with a responsibility to share the filming burden at practices and
tournaments.

*Feedback Structure - *As leadership, we're committed to specifically
discussing with each player how we view their role on the team, how you can
be successful in that role, and what skills you need to work on to get to
the next level/be a better teammate/earn more playing time, etc. We want
these discussions to help simplify player's preparation and give people
concrete ways to grow as players. Furthermore, we want it to be clear how
leadership envisions you excelling in your role on the team, and how you
can grow as a player to take on more responsibility. To accomplish this we
plan to split the team into groups, each with a captain, who will
facilitate these discussions with individual players on a recurring basis.
We want you all to feel comfortable contributing to those discussions, and
hope they can help us grow as individuals and as a team.

*Social Outings - *We are trying to get the team together more through the
offseason and have a few things coming up. More details about the events
will come as we finalize logistics
But to put on your radar

Philly Outing - Early February
Beach Mini and Pinball by Grover's - March / April [Pending Weather]
Camping and Paintball [Early Season, May]

If anyone has any suggestions for other social activities (maybe something
in the city?) feel free to hit up the groupme with them

We want GSU 2019 to be the closest, best organized, and most competitive
team in program history. We want to create a team that people are super
excited to be a part of and where we all have the chance to compete at a
high level with the best players in the area. This was the first of many
meetings and exciting things to come this year.

GSLove,

El Capitans and Coaches

.S Opportunity for undergrad and doctoral students to attend arts performances in Baltimore
.D Mon, 7 Jan 2019 17:50:26 +0000
.M
Dear all:



Some of you may know that there has been a program in place for a while for undergraduates from the Homewood schools to attend various arts performances in Baltimore, along with JHU faculty, and then have dinner afterwards, thanks to contributions from the parents’ fund.



This year, we are pleased to announce that, on a trial basis, we have added two arts outings for doctoral students!  This is a chance for students to get out of their studies for an afternoon and meet some colleagues from different parts of the university.  And of course to experience the arts :)  Please distribute this announcement to doctoral students (and of course to undergrads) in your schools!  All doctoral students are welcome, not just PhD students!  The costs of the tickets and dinner are covered at no cost to the student and accompanying faculty.



The relevant link to distribute is here:  https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/homewoodarts/hopart/   The two shows open to doctoral students are “Fun Home” at Center Stage (Saturday matinee February 23) and “Diary of Anne Frank” at Chesapeake Shakespeare Company (Sunday matinee May 5).  The outing will also include a dinner out after the performance with 2 JHU faculty.  If you or any colleagues would like to go along to the show and then have dinner with the doctoral students, please let me know!  Also, again, please distribute to colleagues who might be interested. The expectation is that 10 students will go to each show, along with 2 faculty members.  The link above includes a place to sign up.  Of course feel free to send any questions my way.

.S 2019 JERSEY ORDER & USAU MEMBERSHIPS
.D Sat, 29 Dec 2018 19:22:29 -0500
.M
Sup boys,

It’s been a while, so we have a lot of things to go over. Please read the whole e-mail and keep an eye out for us sending more information in the next week, including the team store for our light and dark jerseys!

**IMPORTANT** 
All of the info that is collected from this email goes into this spreadsheet:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wpW3KDb5P0Pq7sQjy2z1yyr0xMaou3aSJqZAnDbZGqI/edit#gid=0 <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wpW3KDb5P0Pq7sQjy2z1yyr0xMaou3aSJqZAnDbZGqI/edit#gid=0>


NUMBERS
Before we do our jersey order, we have to figure out everyone’s numbers. We made a spreadsheet to help with this process and put the returner numbers from last year on it. For everyone else, and anyone who wants to change their number, the numbers will be first come first serve, but with some preference to seniority. If someone else has a number that you want, you can contact them and try to work something out.



OPTIONAL GEAR ORDER
We’re getting some cool optional gear this year, and we need numbers from everyone before we place the orders. Let us know if you want a reversible, hat, or R1 (DZ only). There are images attached to the email if you want to check it out.

To place an order, visit the link above and fill it out with the things you want. Payments can be made on Venmo to @Dangerzone-Ultimate once requested.

But, all of this stuff is optional, so you don’t have to get any of it.


USAU MEMBERSHIPS
Finally to play in the spring, everyone has to get a USA Ultimate membership. This applies for both DZ and FZ players!! It’s good to get a head start on this, so if everyone could get this done as soon as possible that’d be great. For the next few days (until Jan 1) there’s a sale on USAU memberships for 2 years, so if you get this done quick then you save some $. If you have any questions about getting a USAU membership, feel free to text me (jimmy) at 484-868-6113.

After you get your membership (or renew your existing one), enter the 6 digit code into the spreadsheet. If you’re a returner, your number is already there, but you can check to make sure it’s right.



Like I said, once we get everyone’s numbers, we’ll send out the main uniform order info for everyone, but we have to do this stuff first. Again, let us know if you need any help.

Keep grinding,
-Jimmy and Tim

.M
Happy Holidays for everyone. Sorry for the delay on this, but many of those
nominated for captain took time try to ensure they could make the proper
decision if they could be the leaders the team needs for next year. Turns
out there were just 3 people who accepted their nomination...so we don't
need to have a vote, we will just have these three awesome people as
captains for next year.

Shank, Jordan, and Magerr have accepted their nomination and are pumped to
start the early planning. Boom so exciting.

I'm sure there will be more stuff coming from all of us soon, but get hype,
and get on Game Point. Jesse's doing a great job with it and will have it
up and running in the new year to get everyone that sport specific training
we all need to take our games to the next level.

Don't forget to throw and visualize.

Hopefully Bo will get some details out to everyone about some socializing
while everyone's home for the holidays!

Miss everyone!

Good evening all,

I just wanted to give everyone a heads up on my coaching decisions for
2019. Firstly, I will not be coaching in the AUDL. For many reasons this is
not where I want to be spending my time. Instead, I am going to be the new
co-owner and head coach of an NYC womxn's professional team. I am starting
the process now and we plan on having a short season between April and June
2019. This is going to take a lot of time and energy, but I'll have lots of
help and support. I'm really excited about this and am looking forward to
coaching women at a high level again.

What this also does is free me up for the GSU season. Because we will end
all pro stuff in June, I can spend all my time and energy on working with
this team during the club season. I'm excited to have these two coaching
gigs separated. This will allow me to concentrate more effectively on GSU
and be at all of the important events.

On a side note, I know that Jesse has been working hard to get everyone set
up and on board with training. Besides me being 100% focused on GSU, anyone
who wants to play on the team in 2019 should be working right now on being
in the best possible shape mentally and physically. A training program is a
great way to do this, and the Game Point Performance group is amazing.
Let's use their knowledge and expertise to help use get to the next
competitive level. If you haven't signed up yet, please reconsider.

There is no I in team, but there is a U in we suck.

Let me know if you'd like to chat. I've had some really nice conversations
with some folks and am happy to have more.

Let's fucking go.

Here is the link to the contribution spreadsheet, add yourself so we don't have 4 people making the same thing unknowingly (I got burned one year picking up the slack that wasn't actually there, it sucks) .

>> 
>> Option negative 1) Do not bring FFC food or some shit. Stealing is not in the spirit of giving. Common freshman mistake. You also wouldn't be contributing anything from yourself while your captains are spending lots of time and money on turkeys for us.
>> 
>>  
>> 
>> Option 1)  One easy thing we need every year is food accessories: Napkins, plasticware, plates, cups. Maybe some condiments like salt/pepper. Incredibly easy, yet an essential contribution. Note: $15-20 dollars can buy you a lot of what we need, so we probably need 1-2 people on this tops. If you plan to do this, make sure it's on the spreadsheet.
>> 
>>  
>> 
>> Option 2)  Make something (where I mean "make" loosely)! If you don't cook, some shit can be easy enough to learn in one go on the web. We've used Cooking for Engineers in the past. It's even easier to buy a bunch of dinner rolls or cornbread and put it on a big platter (We legitimately need someone to do these, sign up). Good vegetables are often underrepresented, and how much easier can you get than carrots or broccoli or some shit? Also note you don't need to bring something "traditional". Do you make a mean/special grilled cheese? Or does your family always buy a few cans of pearled onions that apparently other families don't do (<-me)? Go for it.
>> 
>>  
>> 
>> Option 3) Become somebody's helper/duplicate. If someone else seems to be making a dish that may have a high time or monetary buy-in, ask if they want help. Help out in the kitchen, and give some cash. Maybe learn a senior's signature dish so it can be here next year. In my opinion, cooking alone is the wrong approach to Frisbee Thanksgiving, company is much more fun. If you currently plan to cook alone, maybe ask if someone else has the space for you to cook in the same place as them. On another note, sometimes when people say they will make some staple like mashed potatoes they're not planning to make the whole amount that's needed to feed 30-50 people. So definitely speak to the important dish-makers if you're still searching for a role. Preparing for this event may require you to talk to others on the team you may not have gotten the chance to know yet; In fact, that's a crucial part of the holiday.

>> Other info:

>> If you need to hit a grocery store for whatever reason, there are many cars on the team, and many of their owners are probably gonna be making trips already, so communicate -- send emails to the list with wild abandon. Cars for transporting food to the venue on Saturday may be in higher demand, please figure it out.
>> Dinner is at 7:30 Saturday Dec. 1st in the AMR I Multipurpose Room. You do NOT want to be late, be sure you're done cooking in time.
>> There's a second tab of the spreadsheet dedicated to helping. It would be lovely if those of you whose current job is over once you're handed a receipt also offered some form of help to somebody, even if it's just with something like carrying rather than cooking.
>> I fucking ASSUME there will be partying afterwards to look forward to, otherwise I refuse to be a part of this team in the Spring.

Could ask Bobby to see if we can do a weekend event. And get field space
for it. We do have open practices from now till the 12th I believe. It
would be hard to do it after a practice as we have practices from 9-11pm.

I would put Bob and Ben in charge of this if we want to make it an event.
They'll have the sports club connections to see what field space we can get
outside of normal practice times. I'll push it in the groupme once details
are finalized and maybe guys can post in support of it as well.

Shank- is rutgers having an event open for everyone next week? this years
focus is youth....maybe making an event for it at the end of practice,
pushing more youth players from devyl out there, and then tweet a picture
of HS, college, Club all playing together? also good spark to get the
younger kids interested in the scrims?

We could do something as simple as take our GSU team picture and post a

Hey National Team Coaches,

Hope you all had a nice Thanksgiving.
We've been working with the WFDF SOTG Committee this year on promoting
iSOTG Day. They have requested that we send out a message to key members of
our community to help spread the word and get people connecting with each
other and talking about SOTG.

 http://www.spiritofthegameday.org/

https://www.facebook.com/events/1315398991806286/

Definitely important to stay tuned into what's going on with the rest of
the world in this area. Please browse the info at the links above, pass
along to others in your community, and use the info to help us think about
how we continue to prioritize SOTG on our national teams and beyond.

Let me know if you have questions.

Hello All:

To piggy back off of the last email, please see the following link for
GPP:
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScnkNaX9IBuTd1FZlSHevC1Ml7wUdYH3RnshE7SOIWLPkYCBA/viewform?usp=sf_link

At this point, there have only been 12 responses, and even if you do not
plan on doing it (which I personally believe you should if you want to buy
into the culture and progression of this team), please fill out the
participation sheet.

We need to know how many are planning are participating and how many are
planning on not participating.

Best,
Jesse

Good vegetables are often underrepresented, and how much easier can you get than carrots or broccoli or some shit? Also note you don't need to bring something "traditional". Do you make a mean/special grilled cheese? Or does your family always buy a few cans of pearled onions that apparently other families don't do (<-me)? Go for it.

In my opinion, cooking alone is the wrong approach to Frisbee Thanksgiving, company is much more fun. If you currently plan to cook alone, maybe ask if someone else has the space for you to cook in the same place as them. On another note, sometimes when people say they will make some staple like mashed potatoes they're not planning to make the whole amount that's needed to feed 30-50 people. So definitely speak to the important dish-makers if you're still searching for a role. Preparing for this event may require you to talk to others on the team you may not have gotten the chance to know yet; In fact, that's a crucial part of the holiday.

.S Re: End Of Season Meeting
.M
I took some quick notes, so here they are for those who have forgotten or
weren't able to be there.....


*Pro*- Everyone agreed on the expectation that they need to show up even if
not playing. More explicit team communication about how many spots are
being held. Matty, Jibran and Marques said if they play pro, they would
still prioritize pro games over early season club events. Shank said he
would prioritize club over pro. Potentially Phoenix starts practicing
Yardley, but unsure the feasibility and need to see what happens with both
teams before trying to figure it out.

*Scheduling*: Jake, Bobby, Tristan volunteered to try to host a tourney at
the end of August. Jake has a contact for fields potentially.

Team would commit to a tourney over wildwood if the reps were good.
Team wants more tourneys, NY Invite, Pitt or Boston, Going to Philly
Classic, Chesapeake and hopefully our own or select flight etc.
Team agrees that starting tryouts later (mid to late May) is better and
returners have to show up. Need to work around pro schedule so they can at
least be there. commit to being at all tryouts for perceptions
Everyone was on board with a retreat weekend (grover looking into fields by
his house). Everyone loves doing stuff together, potentially going to fun
tourneys like Henlopen in the spring depending on how many people are doing
Pro and just having fun reps. Bo and Freshman both offered to host after
events near their respective houses for BBQ's. (MCUDL and Rutgers
respectively)

*Strategy* - Is there anyone else who can be an additional coach to help
take some burden from Eileen was brought up. or compartmentalize tasks
between eileen and grover more so they each can be more specialized.
- Everyone liked the structure for feedback and hope it facilitates more
feedback for higher end players.
- If there are skillsets that one player does really well and the team is
struggling AND it fits within the construct of the practice goal, set time
within practice (or extend practice to gain teh time) for them to teach
that particular skill. Not a free for all, but a time to allow a stronger
player work with everoyne on something that fits within the strcuture of
the system.
- Everyone likes the individual feedback spreadsheet sharing and the video
stuff
- An idea was thrown about getting Devyl or HS kids to come film our
practices and help grow them too. Tristan will look into this. Get better
footage earlier that way. They can upload, take that off of eileen.


Pods sometimes didn't work last year, why - Feedback was started too late
and leaders need to be people who can be there early. Too many late then
just didn't get the buy in. So start earlier and coordinate who will do it
better.

Regarding subbing- people didn't think pods with living locations would
gain as much chemistry (more just accountability) because the reps are
smaller scale and not full play, except for secoco mini etc. Everyone liked
the role pod idea but the general feel was that everyone needs not only a
parciular role, but also particular rules. ie can't throw certain things.
this will help control silly turns and motivate people to improve that
skill. People wanted a general idea of O and D still but understood the
benefits of both. People liked the structure of roles though overall.
Figured it could remove some of the issues of soft turns and
miscommunications.

Transparent about lines and tighter line situations and practice. Everyone
liked the format of our last regionals practice a lot and want more of
that. Put in certain situations with certain lines. Everyone knows that
means better commitment and accountability to be there and ready to go.

O/D Strategy-

General feel about the O line issues was that we were too dependant on our
bread and butter (flat hucks) so maybe rules in different scrims to take
away whatever is working well that day to force uncomfrotable situations.
The O line struggled getting to the secondary look when in Viper and split
stack in particular against poaches where the primary look was looked off.
Mostly a chemistry issue but the flow of secondary options felt forced.
Everyone agrees with Defensive thoughts in notes.

Knowing the rules and knowing HOW to react is important to improve. We get
taken advantage of due to our reactions and body language as much as our
lack of knowledge. Must know the correct rules, must react with silence
first then discuss knowing the facts. We are bad at both.

*Workout*- Game point. General buy in. Shank gave a good summary. Jesse
will run point to get it going.
Accountability, can we track peoples check off workouts in the app? Help
support each other mentally and help each other find the reason why we work
hard.


OTHER:

Bobby/Ben, Tristan Shank volunteered to help with the "program
coordination". Start a groupme for all of NJ ultimate slowly growing. Get
reps playing against rutgers at their turf practices. Maybe we can time our
practices in the summer to overlap an hour with Devyl to play against them
and then they can watch us. We want to foster a program and build others
up. It will help us now and in the long run.

Getting a coach for the B team would be very helpful. Dave Hsiung was
mentioned. or Belline after devyl.

Be positive to those who leave the team. They could come back. Some people
feel it's cliquey. Been always positive and friendly for everyone.

.S FRISBEE THANKSGIVING
.M
Gentlemen and Ladies,

Frisbee Thanksgiving will be held on Saturday, December 1st at 7:30pm in
the AMR I MPR.

The quick details are:
What: Bountiful home cooked food and drinks
Where: AMR I MPR
When: 7:30pm
Who: Anyone who has come to even one practice
*Important Note*: Sign up to cook or bring something here
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SVJyBmwYMWeVedOO2S8TZUNAC0KCHwid9ZGgImmJK-0/edit?usp=sharing>.
For details on what you should bring, please read the end of this email but
some necessities have been listed in on the google sheet. *Since it is in
the AMR I MPR, everybody MUST RSVP by Wednesday, November 28th! Do this by
texting your name to 734-516-8577 or by emailing your name to
jhudangerzone@gmail.com <jhudangerzone@gmail.com>*

Hope to see you there!

JHU Men's Ultimate

A more proper frisbee thanksgiving description is provided below by our
late friend Graham Smith

First thing's first, *everyone who is going is expected to contribute in
some way*. Ideally, your contribution should have a *perceived value of $15
at minimum*. Here
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SVJyBmwYMWeVedOO2S8TZUNAC0KCHwid9ZGgImmJK-0/edit?usp=sharing>
is
the link to the contribution spreadsheet, *add yourself so we don't have 4
people making the same thing unknowingly *(I got burned one year picking up
the slack that wasn't actually there, it sucks) .

*If you are either not on this spreadsheet or are all like "I don't know
what to do", this email is for you. READ IT.*



*Option negative 1) *Do not bring FFC food or some shit. Stealing is not in
the spirit of giving. Common freshman mistake. You also wouldn't be
contributing anything from yourself while your captains are spending lots
of time and money on turkeys for us.



*Option 1) * One easy thing we need every year is *food accessories*:
Napkins, plasticware, plates, cups. Maybe some condiments like salt/pepper.
Incredibly easy, yet an essential contribution. Note: $15-20 dollars can
buy you a lot of what we need, so we probably need 1-2 people on this tops. *If
you plan to do this, make sure it's on the spreadsheet.*



*Option 2)  **Make something* (*where I mean "make" loosely*)! If you don't
cook, some shit can be easy enough to learn in one go on the web. We've
used Cooking for Engineers in the past. It's even easier to *buy a bunch of
dinner rolls or cornbread and put it on a big platter* (We legitimately
need someone to do these, sign up). Good vegetables are often
underrepresented, and how much easier can you get than carrots or
broccoli or some shit? Also note you don't need to bring something
"traditional". Do you make a mean/special grilled cheese? Or does your
family always buy a few cans of pearled onions that apparently other
families don't do (<-me)? Go for it.



*Option 3) **Become somebody's helper/duplicate.* If someone else seems to
be making a dish that may have a high time or monetary buy-in, ask if they
want help. Help out in the kitchen, and give some cash. Maybe learn a
senior's signature dish so it can be here next year. In my opinion, cooking
alone is the wrong approach to Frisbee Thanksgiving, company is much more
fun. If you currently plan to cook alone, maybe ask if someone else has the
space for you to cook in the same place as them. On another note, sometimes
when people say they will make some staple like mashed potatoes they're
not planning to make the whole amount that's needed to feed 30-50
people. So definitely speak to the important dish-makers if you're still
searching for a role. Preparing for this event may require you to talk to
others on the team you may not have gotten the chance to know yet; In
fact, that's a crucial part of the holiday.





*Other info:*


   - *If you need to hit a grocery store for whatever reason, there are
   many cars on the team, and many of their owners are probably gonna be
   making trips already, so communicate -- send emails to the list with wild
   abandon. Cars for transporting food to the venue on Saturday may be in
   higher demand, please figure it out.*
   - *Dinner is at 7:30 Saturday Dec. 1st in the AMR I Multipurpose Room.
   You do NOT want to be late, be sure you're done cooking in time.*
   - *There's a second tab of the spreadsheet dedicated to helping. It
   would be lovely if those of you whose current job is over once you're
   handed a receipt also offered some form of help to somebody, even if it's
   just with something like carrying rather than cooking.*
   - *I fucking ASSUME there will be partying afterwards to look forward
   to, otherwise I refuse to be a part of this team in the Spring.*
   - *If I forgot anything or messed up somewhere, chime in.*

.S Re: End Of Season Meeting
.M
Wanted to share an agenda put together by Grover and Eileen, some of the
topics they touched upon from their meeting and good starting points for
our meeting. Take a look and come prepared with your own thoughts and
questions and ideas.

GSU Planning Agenda

Nov 18th 2018



1- Pro Club Interaction/Expectation

-Expectation of coming to practices and tryouts if games don’t directly
conflict. Too many missing last year. If players can’t play but the time
doesn’t conflict, still show up. Be a part of the team.

- Roster transparency regarding how many spots committed to and being held.
Communication to individuals was done last year, but not clearly to
everyone.

- Eileen's status with Pro

- How to improve practice if there’s a pro game, prioritizing tourney or pro

- If a lot of people are doing pro, commit even as a practice player so we
get reps together

- Thoughts and Input? Who’s planning to do what?

2- Scheduling

   -

   Tournaments- Grover will discuss the situation. If we want more reps,
   Boston and Pitt?, do we want more low level tourneys vs practice? Host our
   own and recruit?
   -

   Team Events- Need a retreat weekend
   -

   Practices- Format and length on average from feedback was good.
   -

      In order to have more scrimmage/mini based practices, to focus on
      creating game situations, people must have individual
accountability to do
      drills in pods and work to improve the skills needed to improve the
      scrimmages
      -

   Ideas and Volunteers?


3- Strategy and Feedback

   -

   Comment about individualized Feedback
   -

      Coaches had a spreadsheet we filled in after every tournament for
      individual feedback so that we could give it to those who wanted. We can
      just make this public next year.
      -

      Video and review- We can better with this with the spreadsheet and
      more film late in the season. We need to do it all the time and everyone
      has to buy in. If you want more feedback, putting in the work of adding
      your own comments and questions helps facilitate the feedback
      -

      Individualized feedback takes a ton of time and effort. It takes a
      village.
      -

         Consider having each captain have a group of players that they
         help facilitate individual feedback, check in with each other
and help be
         there
         -

   Subbing comments
   -

      Subbing can absolutely improve. Two Ideas to consider instead of the
      3 line structure currently (to potentially get away from the O D
mentality)
      -

         Create a Pod Structure based on role and then rotate X number from
         within that role (pods of cutters, pods of center handlers, pods of
         distributor handlers etc; based on what Matty does with Fury).
         -

            Pros- this gives everyone a set role on the field
            -

            Cons- leaves less room for chemistry and improvisation
            -

         Create a Pod Structure based on Living locations.
         -

            Pros- Lines can build chemistry, accountability of workouts,
            and each line can have unique tactics
            -

            Cons- Requires buy in so everyone puts in the work to get the
            chemistry.
            -

      Any other subbing suggestions? We know if can improve and want more
      ideas.
      -

   Offense
   -

      From feedback and rewatching film
      -

         Need to be more aggressive throwing downfield
         -

         Most reset turns are on discs going backwards and leads to
         opponent fast breaks. Must dedicate to the system of forward
resetting and
         resets have to commit to setting up to facilitate
         -

         If back, MUST get the swing and continue. No Dancing.
         -

         Majority of turns were soft. This is an execution problem that
         needs individual accountability. Hopefully the earlier
playbook will remove
         communication issues, but everyone needs to hold themselves
to a higher
         standard on turnovers. Remember, 1 turn per person per game
is 189 turns in
         a weekend and 27 turns per game. No team will win like that.
         -

         Fakes and pivoting - not done with a purpose, and therefore
         frequently at the wrong time; especially true with younger
throwers - would
         be better to just stand still until ready to throw
         -

            Only fake/pivot to communicate and do it with a purpose
            -

               Move mark
               -

               Communicate to cutter
               -

               Move defender/poachers
               -

               Set up next throw
               -

         Cut timing - people were waiting until person catches and then
         decide to cut (due to lack of trust in system/handlers); need to have
         better timing, but also throwers need to help this by turning
and throwing
         - want this to be THE focus of early season (this coupled with the
         fakes/pivoting - basically do triangle of death and marking
drill every
         practice)
         -

      We need to double down on plays and structure. We have been building
      the playbook and sent it out late in the year last year. We will continue
      to build it and will send it out earlier.
      -

      Any other thoughts about Offense?
      -

   Defense
   -

      The past couple years we’ve had a spreadsheet with all the teams we
      play, their team strategy, and particular players and matches we want to
      see. We can build more and make this public. Anyone with more
contributions
      can help provide it early so it can be combined and given out
      -

      Must improve
      -

         Crumble from zone
         -

         Marking - needs to be much more active; we are easily broken
         because people are mostly flat footed and upright
         -

         Switching and poaching defensive looks
         -

      Any other Defensive thoughts?
      -

   General
   -

      Being too nice - we are literally the only team that calls our own
      fouls and lets others dictate the flow of the game; we need to be tougher
      and more certain of the rules so we can make confident calls; also,
      everyone needs to follow the play so we have others to back up
(especially
      in/out calls when we don't have observers)
      -

      Recruiting- It is everyone’s responsibility to recruit and we all
      have to be proactive. If you think someone else will do a good
job, or you
      want to talk about how to do it, ask.
      -

      Individual accountability. We need to continue to improve pushing
      ourselves, making the sacrifices and showing each other that we are doing
      so. It’s an important life skill. How can we help improve this?
      -

      Any other feedback?

4. Workouts

   1.

   Team needs to decide and commit
   1.

      Options - UAP or Game Point Performance
      2.

   Being better about managing time and working on mental game
   1.

      Recognize that we all put a lot of pressure on ourselves.
      2.

      What can we do to be better at supporting each other?



5- Leadership

   -

   Nominations for people (think about if you’d be willing to do it)
   -

   Blind Vote



6- Volunteers to champion important planning

    A- Tournament Planning

    B- Practice Field Site Coordination (insurance with USAU)

    C- Fundraising

    D- Social stuff and Tune Up Coordination

    E - Workout coordination with Game Point/UAP

.S Schedule for the final project presentations
.M
The schedule for the final project presentations is posted on the course
web page:
http://mt-class.org/jhu/project.html

Your presentations should include
- summary of the project idea
- motivation why this is an interesting project to work on
- core method
- evaluation method / metric
- details of technical execution
- data sets used
- experimental results
- findings

Since the presentation is well before the deadline of the project, you may
not have any results yet, or even some aspects of your method worked out.
That is fine. View this presentation as a opportunity to get feedback and
organize your work.

Since the first presentation day is just after Thanksgiving, I scheduled
all the single-person project then. If you do not think you could possibly
present that day, please email me and I will reschedule you. However,
please try to make an effort.

Important: Attendance in the class has been lower in recent lectures (and
that is fine) but please support your fellow students and attend their
project presentations.

Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff:



The JHU facilities team is working to keep walkways and parking areas clear today as we see a heavier accumulation of snow than we anticipated based on the forecasts. Please use caution when walking or driving on our campuses and report any areas that need attention by calling 6-8063.



We expect that the precipitation will turn to rain this afternoon and the temperature will remain above freezing. We encourage you to continue to be careful on your afternoon commute and into the evening hours.?

.S Wellness initiative: Free F45 classes on Nov/10 and Nov/14
.M
Dear all,

A few weeks back we asked you to fill out a survey to find the best times
you would prefer to attend the GRO-sponsored F45 classes. So, we will like
to thank everybody who responded to the survey. The dates the majority of
you voted for were on *Saturday at 1:00 pm* for a cardio+resistance hybrid
class and *Wednesday at 6:30 pm* for a cardio based class. The classes have
been scheduled with the Rec Center, and they are visible in the JHU Rec
Center app. *Please note that these classes are only available to Graduate
Students of KSAS and WSE.*

To register for the classes, please follow these steps:

   1. Download the JHU Rec app from the play store
   <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FitDegree.JohnsHopkinsUniversity>,
   or app store
   <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/johns-hopkins-recreation/id1245199314?mt=8>,
   or as an alternative, you can use the Fit Degree website
   <https://app.fitdegree.com/>.
   2. Register for the *Saturday, November 10th*; or *Wednesday, November
   14th* class. Note that priority will be given to people registered in
   the app.
   3. Register in advance *ONLY* if you are completely certain you will
   attend. *First come first serve spaces will be available at the time of
   the class to compensate for "no-shows"*.
   4. If it is your first time registering using this app, sign the waiver
   that will appear on the screen.
   5. Come to class and ENJOY! ****Class starts at the shown time, entrance
   to the studio will be denied if the class already started since the timer
   cannot be stopped once it has started.*

If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact us.

Best regards,
GRO Social and Wellness Chairs
