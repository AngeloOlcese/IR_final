Hey everyone,

Due to the inclement weather, we are cancelling tryouts for today. We were
unable to secure turf fields and in an effort to preserve our practice
fields for the entirety of the season we have felt that this is the best
course of action.

*The second open tryout will be moved to next Saturday (5/18), 10am-1pm @
MCUDL fields (4040 Quakerbridge Rd Trenton NJ)*. This will be a joint
tryout with Pine Baroness the local women's team. So stay after for some
post tryout activities. Details to follow!

We appreciate everyone's flexibility and will send out a reminder email
next week. We will be making a round of cuts following Saturday's open
tryout and will proceed to have invite tryouts on Sunday (5/19),
9am-12pm @Skelly Field. The early tryout times is to help accommodate  the
pro schedule and to allow for pro players to tryout still.


If you have any questions regarding your status / general feed back please
feel free to reach out to one of the captains or to Grover.

Hey all,

With GSU tryouts starting this weekend, we wanted to reach out to give you
some final details. We are super excited about this season and the great
growth and changes in store. The first weekend schedule will be open
tryouts at Skelly Fields (57 Dudley Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901, USA) on
both *Saturday May 11th and Sunday May 12th from 3pm to 6pm*. Please arrive
at least 15 minutes early to sign in and introduce yourself and start

Tryouts will be heavily focused in simulated scrimmage and mini settings to
see how you can work as a group to help your line succeed. Spacing and

For our team strategy this year, we are going to live by three core
values. *Work
hard, Do your Part, and Be Yourself*. We want to foster a culture where
every action you do is at 100% from drills to scrimmage, to workouts, to
sideline passion. Everyone wants to play for different reasons, but what
unites us is that everyone is passionate about playing this sport as a unit
to achieve the success we all desire. If we each do our part, give 100%,
and help each other have fun and show our passion in our own ways, the team
success and individual success will follow.

We are super excited for this season and look forward to seeing everyone
out there on Saturday. If you have any questions, please reach out. Don't

I wanted follow up quickly. These are the events to which I alluded in my

We are deeply saddened and have been dealing with the loss throughout the
week. The family wants to limit this announcement to Tianshi's friends and
collegues. Let us respect their wishes and keep this within the community.
If you receive inquiries from outside the computer science department,

Hi all,

Just another quick reminder about this survey.  We would *really*
appreciate your responses.  I know that this week is busy for everyone, but
it really shouldn't take more than 5-10 minutes to fill out the survey, and
it would help us tremendously.  The survey will officially by open until
May 20, so you have another two weeks to complete it.  But again, it should
be reasonably quick, and the department (and the D&I committee in
particular) would really appreciate your participation.

As a reminder, the survey can be found at
https://forms.gle/EhxT5eqQ6mHrg7QD6

If you have any questions about the survey, please don't hesitate to
contact me.

Best,

.S  CS Seminar Speaker: Vishal Patel– "Deep Networks for Open Set Visual Recognition"
.D Tue, 30 Apr 2019 13:55:55 +0000
.M
Speaker:  Vishal Patel, Johns Hopkins University
Date & Time: May 2, 2019 at 10:30 am
Location: Hackerman B17
Title: Deep Networks for Open Set Visual Recognition

Abstract:

Over the last five years, methods based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have shown impressive performance improvements for object detection and recognition problems. This has been made possible due to the availability of large annotated datasets, a better understanding of the non-linear mapping between input images and class labels as well as the affordability of GPUs. However, a vast majority of DCNN-based recognition methods are designed for a closed world, where the primary assumption is that all categories are known a priori. In many real-world applications, this assumption does not necessarily hold. In this talk, I will present some of my recent works on developing DCNN-based algorithms for open set recognition as well as novelty detection and one-class recognition. I will conclude my talk by describing several promising directions for future research.
Bio:

GShomies,

Hope everyone's off-season is going well. Very excited for the upcoming
season and can't wait to hit the field with you all in just a few weeks.

The leadership has been working hard on implementing some new philosophies
and creating more structure for the upcoming season in a form of a playbook.

The playbook will serve as a reference guide as we progress through the
season with plays / drills.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d-Y6Y-PJ4c3CSCb1uqY3DBREyeKwnPch/view

We wanted to share this with you all to get your opinion on what we have
compiled thus far as well as anything that you think we should add /
remove. The more ideas that we begin to circulate between ourselves. the
better prepared we will be come the start of the season.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts


Shank

Hello,

Attached is my completed final examination. I have had a hectic week and was gone all weekend so have not had sufficient time to satisfactorily complete my conference paper presentation slides. I was hoping I could present next week, though I understand if this will affect my presentation grade. I will work hard to get my slides in before the end of tomorrow.

Thank you,

Guidelines for "Summer Independent Research":
Students who are employed in the summer may register for "Summer Independent Research". The course number is either AS.990.892 or EN.990.892. This course is specifically for the prevention of FICA taxation. The grade for AS/EN 990.892 is NG, "No Grade Given". "Summer Independent Research" carries no academic weight and should not be confused with an independent study or research course offered during the summer which carries a department and course number.

.D Thu, 25 Apr 2019 22:23:30 +0000
.M
To anyone in department who is practicing Passover: Our order for tomorrow consists of Shahi Paneer, Malai Kofta, and Chicken Biryani (and rice). We asked the restaurant and they said the Shahi Paneer does not contain any wheat, so hopefully that should be a suitable option for most of you. Malai Kofta does have corn. We will also have wine.

In general, if our happy hours make it difficult to observe your religious/cultural practices, please let us know. We understand that in winters it may be difficult for some people who practice Shabbat to attend the happy hours. We have been discussing this with some students, but if that is indeed impacting anyone directly, please let us know. We want to make sure that our department is diverse and inclusive and none of the communities in our department are unfairly deprived of any activities.

Hello fitness enthusiasts!
First, please join us in congratulating our F45 Playoffs winners!
F45 Playoffs were held last Friday, 4/19 from 4:45-6pm in the F45 studio.
We had a record 54 attendees come out to participate in the F45 benchmark fitness testing!

Top 3 Men:
Arpad N. - 1st place (Arpad is a first time F45 Playoffs competitor and is the new reigning Overall Hopkins record holder!)
Ryan W. - 2nd place
Andy H. - 3rd place (Congratulations Andy for beating your previous Playoffs score by a whopping 105 points!)

Top 3 Women:
Lulu E. - 1st place (Lulu is a first time F45 Playoffs competitor and is the new non-trainer reigning Women's Hopkins record holder!)
Taylor D.. - 2nd place
Riti G.. - 3rd place

Campus Scavenger Hunt for Rec Swag is tomorrow, Thursday, 4/25
Last year's scavenger hunt was such a success that we're doing it again! Look high, look low, look in the flower pots and in the far corners of campus. No location is off limits!
Starting at 9am, the hunt is on for plastic blue eggs around the Homewood campus. Open your egg and you'll find a mini t-shirt, sticker, or fanny pack inside.
Bring your egg to the Rec Center by the end of the day to swap the mini-replica for a full-size prize!

Save the date!
Rec's annual Poker Walk/Run is scheduled for Friday, May 3rd from 11am-12pm. Stay tuned for more information.

DangerDogs,

D-Day is near. We have a huge task ahead of us this weekend, but we’re about to show the region who the scrappiest fucking dogs are when we show up every single game with more grit and the loudest WEEWOO MUTHERFUCKING BROTHER ALERTS that they have ever heard. At this point last year, I was hype to be going to regionals. This year, I’m hype to be on a team trying to win regionals. It is unreal to see the improvement from the end of last year to now. All of my brethren have shown how much they want it and I’m proud to stand next to y’all and fight for our spot to go to natties. Every time I step onto the field this weekend, I’m giving everything I have because I know damn well that the six people next to me are doing the same thing. More than anything, I’m excited. I’m excited to see our O-line play that elite offense that makes the other D-line walk off the field sad and questioning how they got roasted so bad so quickly. I’m excited to see D-line get in the face and absolutely frustrate everybody who has the disc into throwing a turn or a stall 9 huck because nobody could get open anyway. I’m excited to see our HoundZone confuse other teams and show our opponents that if you can’t hang with the big dogs, you better just go home. Let’s go get it Hop. Rising.

Woof.

Your brother,

Alex

Sorry to disturb you. This is Shanshan Yang, your classmate of Advanced Computer Forensics. I was assigned to review your paper work. I would like to say sorry to you, because I brought your hardcopy to our school library and lost it somewhere. Since I haven’t finished it, I wonder would you mind sending me an electronic copy of your paper? Looking forward to hearing from you.

Hi all,

I’m excited to invite you to an upcoming philanthropy event we are 
hosting at Johns Hopkins in a couple of weeks. As I’m sure you know, 
philanthropy is a huge part of our culture at Bloomberg. Our employees 
have the opportunity to give back in numerous ways to organizations and 
communities, both near and far. One of the many ways we donate is 
through volunteer time. We are hosting a “BOB” (Best of Bloomberg) event 
in Baltimore with some of our local partners and employees. We’ll be 
working in teams to build 250 bikes for students in Under Armor House 
afterschool programs, who have been trained in a bike safety class.

Here are some details:


*Date*: Friday, May 3^rd
*Time*: 12:30pm – 5:30pm (lunch will be served at 12:30 and we’ll have 
Bloomberg t-shirts for you)
*Location*: UA House Baltimore, 1100 E Fayette St, Baltimore, MD 21202

*RSVP*: http://tinyurl.com/y2vh78rl

If you aren’t able to attend for the entire shift, that’s no problem! 
We’d love to have you help whenever you can.

We’ll be sending an email confirmation with more details next week.

Thanks so much! Katie

No this is pretty standard, WM provided me w a large number of relo dollars after 12/31 so there’s probably 100 people in the same position

Jet pays the taxes on your relo so it has no real impact.

Hello,

Thank you for getting back to me. I appreciate you taking the time to sort this out for me. Final question, I am trying to file my taxes for this year, so just to be clear you are saying that my relocation dollars for being relocated in 2018 will be shown as part of my income for 2019? I am clearly not an expert here so just trying to make sure I understand as this will negatively affect me if true.

Thank you for looking into this for me,

My wages in 2017 were $38154.36 but in 2018 were $16198.35 although they should be much more similar. Both years I was given corporate housing at Oakwood, and in 2018 i received a pay increase of $5 more an hour so if anything total wages should be higher in 2018 than in 2017. Do you have any insights to what could have changed or if there is any kind of mistake?

The grad social talk is April 9th, Tue from 5 to 6 pm in Malone 228.

There will be pizza and beers(yes we have) (as well as non-alcoholic drinks).
We will have two speakers this time.


Speaker: Rob DiPietro
Topic: Automated Surgical Activity Recognition in Robot-Assisted Surgery
Abstract: Surgical activity recognition is an important precursor to goals such as objective performance assessment and automated feedback for trainees, which have the potential to transform surgical training curricula and in turn improve patient outcomes. This talk discusses recent progress in recognizing gestures (short, low-level activities) and maneuvers (longer, higher-level activities that are part of current training curricula). First, we focus on recognition under the assumption that many densely-annotated sequences are available, and we show that recurrent neural networks yield state-of-the-art performance in this setting. Second, we focus on recognition under the assumption of scarce annotations, where only a single annotated sequence is available for training. We demonstrate the feasibility of activity recognition in this setting for the first time, and we show that performance improves when recognition is preceded by an unsupervised representation-learning phase. We find these results especially exciting; in the future, robot-assisted surgery will provide us with vast amounts of high-quality but unannotated surgical-motion data, and we believe that the ability to leverage this data will be crucial to further progress.


Speaker: Eli Sherman
Topic: Intervening on Friendships
Abstract: Causal inference simulates intervening on nature and considering the quantitative effects on the variables in a system. Traditionally this is done by changing the values of ('treatment') variables and in turn estimating the value of some outcome variable. Recent work has extended these ideas to handle data on networks of interacting agents (flu vaccine and contagiousness data, online social media interactions, etc.). In this talk I'll discuss a modified version of the conventional framework that allows us to consider the effect of changing the nature of relationships between agents in a network. We boldly and bluntly term this new framework: the friendship intervention. I'll motivate these ideas with examples from the political economy, namely Brexit and other examples of EU tomfoolery -- er, "membership shakeups". As with all CS Social Talks, the pizza, pop (ok, fine, "soda"), and beer will be free.

See you all there!

Note: As a reminder, the social talks will be very high level/informal/casual talks/discussions on different topics that graduate students are working on in our department. The idea is to give graduate students and postdocs an opportunity to learn about all the research that is happening here so that they can have a better idea about projects to join or qualifying projects to pick.
If you want to talk about your work in detail, please sign up for the student seminars!

Hello Kerry,

My name is Angelo Olcese and I interned with Jet.com for the past two summers and wanted to reach out because my W-2 forms between the two summers are drastically different. My wages in 2017 were $38154.36 but in 2018 were $16198.35 although they should be much more similar. Both years I was given corporate housing at Oakwood, and in 2018 i received a pay increase of $5 an hour so if anything total wages should be higher than 2017. Do you have any insights to what could have changed or if there is any kind of mistake?

.S NLP course offering change for Fall
.D Fri, 5 Apr 2019 16:11:26 -0400
.M
Dear Students,

If you are interested/planning to take a course in natural language 
processing this fall, please read carefully about these changes to the 
schedule and adjust your carts before Monday morning accordingly:

1) *We are adding a new course EN.601.467/667 Intro to Human Language 
Technology, MW 3-4:15*. This course will be taught by a variety of 
faculty in CLSP, coordinated by Prof. Koehn. Here is the full description:

This course gives an overview of basic foundations and applications of 
human language technology, such as: morphological, syntactic, semantic, 
and pragmatic processing; machine learning; signal processing; speech 
recognition; speech synthesis; information retrieval; text 
classification; topic modelling; information extraction; knowledge 
representation; machine translation; dialog systems; etc. [Applications]

/Pre-req: EN.601.226 Data Structures; knowledge of Python recommended. 
Students may receive credit for at most one of 601.467/667./


2) *We are cancelling EN.601.465/665 Natural Language Processing for 
now*. It is very likely that Prof. Eisner will not be available to teach 
it. We are looking into other faculty to offer the course in the Fall or 
Spring of next academic year, but would rather cancel at this time so 
that you don't get stuck registering for something that might not be 
offered. Our recommendation is to take the new course if you are 
interested in this area, but with the disclaimer that it will be a very 
different approach as a broader survey course. If we are able to offer 
465/665 NLP in the fall, we will send out further announcements and do 
our best to maintain some priorities in registration.

Apologies for the inconvenience of this last minute change. On the 
bright side, we have a new course in the NLP area!

Dear Sirs:

I receive your email with much interest as the check for the March Rent was sent to Second Century.
Upon checking with my bank, as they issued the check, they inform me that the check was sent but has NOT been cashed as of last Friday.
At this time to cancel the check would take 2 to 3 days and to return the funds to my account it would be an additional week. At this time I need confirmation from your office that indeed Second Century has NOT forwarded the check to you so I can proceed to cancel the check and issue a new one. Like I explained before, this process will take about ten days.
Obviously the late payment charge is unfair as this is a result of your change of agent and lack of communication between you.
In addition I am sending you $675 for the parking charge.

I am also including the $200 charge for water Usage to cover up to April.

Hey Spring (Circuit) Breakers!

Hope everyone had a great spring break! Perfect time to clear your mental caches, close some brain tabs, and come back to tackle the semester with a cold reboot!

The reason I’ve hijacked your inbox today is to invite you to join TCO Labs and ACM to learn how you can get involved in the startup world as a CS student this Thursday (Mar. 28) @ 6 pm in Malone G35. Hear from students with past experiences interning at startups in machine learning, full stack software engineering, UI/UX, and at student-founded ventures. You’ll learn how to find startups that interest you, how to negotiate paid vs. unpaid internships, but most importantly, you’ll gain firsthand knowledge about the impact you can have as an intern in a startup. Snacks will be provided!

More info here!

.S IMPORTANT - Revised Graduate CS Course Requirements
.D Tue, 26 Mar 2019 19:58:07 +0000
.M
Dear CS Graduate Students,
The faculty have voted to revise the coursework requirements for the Computer Science MSE and PhD programs.  The new requirements will be mandatory starting Fall 2019 for any newly admitted CS graduate student. Continuing CS graduate students will have the option to complete their coursework under the old distribution requirements OR the new distribution requirements.


OLD REQUIREMENTS: Computer Science MSE and PhD students were formerly required to include 2 Analysis, 2 Applications, and 2 Systems courses in their coursework.



NEW REQUIREMENTS:  Starting Fall 2019, Computer Science MSE and PhD students will be required to include 1 Theory, 1 Applications, 1 Systems, 1 Software, and 1 Reasoning course in their coursework. These 5 new designators reflect the breadth of approaches in CS today.  By taking at least one course of each type, students will accumulate a broadly useful set of perspectives and tools.  Every graduate course in the department has been given a single designator, and the department consistently offers a choice of several courses with each designator.  The 5 designators are explained in the CS Curriculum Committee proposal<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GqMB6kjhrWsjQ6w0XnGsEOVhddxEZeeBQ9Xy_sm1JEo/edit>, along with the overall rationale for the new system.  A current listing of courses with area designators<http://cs.jhu.edu/courses/courseareas.pdf> is provided on the CS departmental website.
 UNCHANGED REQUIREMENTS:  Course selections must be approved by the student's academic advisor.  The total number of required courses remains at 8, although note that within that total, the number of elective courses has increased from 2 to 3.  The elective courses can be courses from any JHU department, including Computer Science.  Students also remain able to fulfill requirements by transferring graduate credit from another institution, with departmental approval.  In addition to these 8 required courses, a graduate student must elect one of the following options in order to complete the MSE degree requirements:
*  2 additional (graduate-level) courses in Computer Science, approved by their CS advisor.
*  An original, faculty-approved master's essay, submitted to the Milton S. Eisenhower Library.
*  A faculty-supervised research project including an approved project report that will be made publicly available.  For students enrolled in the PhD program, a PhD qualifying project may be used to meet this requirement.
Best,

Now that Spring has officially sprung, explore the great outdoors and
celebrate the solstice with a hike to the area’s best waterfalls. What
better way to kick off the warmer weather than with a trek through nature?
Just a short drive away, all of these spots are sure to shake off those
winter blues.

   1. Cascade Falls
   <http://link.entrata.com/wf/click?upn=Oe8QTrMMIB4rSfhOSMZ3pyo0Aj-2BfYO4M4M-2FbqgPn9dJc7oIbESDQ62iEbAhpYGO0ey2EvWbMygp8-2BRAhPlmteY-2FX1IfiGwN-2B73qoq7YtEpFztXO6PvChwho6I7I7Vej8_b6QOdLJySRtq-2BPcfjFizgOp7ldmpbX-2B6tfTmGmCVpRdX90VqP5dn9heN4Xkqy6aVgE7oC3SbDMUahxTyWqO8SRuficnau-2F6t7ax0QcSAiiL4p8Z8BypNblLvsrUTaxsSOEM6h3asEpyKfDsgimHb7uYX65KfC8KUT7pSrJI-2B9usjEUce-2F-2BSXVsKHAumYeEYLECF1o4okhrfAfiUr2hO8TpDjrs11XyrtPbXYvVFN8uEt4tta-2BWCemSm9vgQPWROP2LVSPp6nTf5rv50YsdAbtyFtm1r1Hmde58BhVqZJapDbLRCiLfOY1Ok7L6H-2BckKUceLScmqn9O66aciiZJ3FThLe0wBVnI7VSdqaQ745KKXDQu-2BZ32IFvapXM1jEQ612fB1UOhLyGGyHy0ItwkDRzX7DrcUmZdVb6LJhA4WDnps-3D>
.
   Though the trail loop becomes very steep, the hike is very rewarding
   through lush forest, with the falls as the light at the end of the
   tunneling woods.
   2. Historically, Kilgore Falls
   <http://link.entrata.com/wf/click?upn=Mcn4dWkAWZluhsGVox4Et1rSYlCj4SE0HYhFki2gxG6fh2MPm8aiYsV39BVd71tc3hj2XkgouAjPuFnbzFKvKAwYRy5bvKVKEiSy5RwCsQg-3D_b6QOdLJySRtq-2BPcfjFizgOp7ldmpbX-2B6tfTmGmCVpRdX90VqP5dn9heN4Xkqy6aVgE7oC3SbDMUahxTyWqO8SRuficnau-2F6t7ax0QcSAiiL4p8Z8BypNblLvsrUTaxsSOEM6h3asEpyKfDsgimHb7uYX65KfC8KUT7pSrJI-2B9usjEUce-2F-2BSXVsKHAumYeEYLECF1o4okhrfAfiUr2hO8TpDjrs11XyrtPbXYvVFN8uE-2Fqk7JeCA4IPeEuRD6-2B6nTCghq2Oeat-2BStZ4GNHgNtDJjxztfZ5HAPKL1kBiKWGev7E2CYRRIjZHlQpwNqfO3jgJHzknyWzhkNrZnmCtQ-2B-2BokhoQlX6zWBNmrAlkKkrgntw3g6i6rPfM5c-2FZjSvAHaispT83-2B8qWqZMsiCd0zL5cD5r9VnKZcPbvM6AOVfs7Q-3D>
was
   the bathing hole for the Susquehanna natives in the Harford County Area…
   but we recommend a swimsuit when you visit. Known as the second largest
   vertical falls in Maryland—30ft. high—you can practice your rock climbing
   up the massive rock walls that enclose three sides of the area.
   3. Cunningham Falls State Park
   <http://link.entrata.com/wf/click?upn=Mcn4dWkAWZluhsGVox4Et1rSYlCj4SE0HYhFki2gxG6fh2MPm8aiYsV39BVd71tcqR2-2BzQ3-2B9-2F-2F3yhVDfJkiU6V10iC0G8EeAYPNU2fWeXM-3D_b6QOdLJySRtq-2BPcfjFizgOp7ldmpbX-2B6tfTmGmCVpRdX90VqP5dn9heN4Xkqy6aVgE7oC3SbDMUahxTyWqO8SRuficnau-2F6t7ax0QcSAiiL4p8Z8BypNblLvsrUTaxsSOEM6h3asEpyKfDsgimHb7uYX65KfC8KUT7pSrJI-2B9usjEUce-2F-2BSXVsKHAumYeEYLECF1o4okhrfAfiUr2hO8TpDjrs11XyrtPbXYvVFN8uGU9PEaKTtR4wC10BtOSllJwQBGyMXOj5D6BIJEx9Kyv49c8lOxu2rn5brKHnMdK2ojmSR-2BtW2E5cp4DoJrZ9suQwV9WTiybs8vwYc208xgqpCEKMjNQyk8ZarJ09vlmSp1QccuMe5YT2aAv6nrrajklLeatIY8BIZmLty6MZ6mlXcpP01tOKyaX0iNZcgT7zQ-3D>
in
   Frederick, Maryland has clearly-marked trails throughout the park that lead
   you to the base of the 78-foot cascading waterfall. Arrive to the park
   early as it gets very busy during the day.
   4. Tales of mysterious happenings are tied to the Paw Paw Tunnel
   <http://link.entrata.com/wf/click?upn=Oe8QTrMMIB4rSfhOSMZ3p1VdIOcYGa74GY62ivJzvcOeW7HYy7XESbpFXj4rxG3CJtDSo2wakJGOmdURajAhaAfY160ByTSAZ1Em44CuJW8-3D_b6QOdLJySRtq-2BPcfjFizgOp7ldmpbX-2B6tfTmGmCVpRdX90VqP5dn9heN4Xkqy6aVgE7oC3SbDMUahxTyWqO8SRuficnau-2F6t7ax0QcSAiiL4p8Z8BypNblLvsrUTaxsSOEM6h3asEpyKfDsgimHb7uYX65KfC8KUT7pSrJI-2B9usjEUce-2F-2BSXVsKHAumYeEYLECF1o4okhrfAfiUr2hO8TpDjrs11XyrtPbXYvVFN8uEDhiBUqZ8xr46TGajDma0dzp-2F4xLuprO1NL7XcDYd68YTLm1QjwbIN6FhSmjsmF-2BcrYOlHO6GwHXxz9MiHZBls0yD7RItkJq2wkITk-2FS3ZerCjcXITp4hVkpoIKzPuagJxWEo-2BfCtVh8jbyujX9Zp2MMP8-2FZJ9dsWXcdhW9uWe6LFaoQJxNptz2oQsyEAWyZ0-3D>,
   often causing this trail to be labeled as haunted. But if you’re not one
   for ghost stories, it should be easy to trek through the dark tunnel and
   find the haunting beauty of the trickling waterfall at the end.
   5. A haven for hiking, the C&O National Historic Park borders Maryland
   and Virginia—there, the Potomac River rushes between the two states. And
   that also happens to be the site of some *great falls*. Need a guide?
   The Billy Goat Trail is the most traveled path through the park to arrive
   at the falls. And though it’s no Niagara Falls, witness as Great Falls

   about 40 feet, soon channeling to Mather Gorge—whitewater favorited by

   this picturesque waterfall is only a short 1.5-mile hike along the
   easily-navigated Canyon Loop Trail. Once there, look up — Muddy Creek Falls
   is the highest free-falling waterfall in the state, falling a whopping
   50-plus feet! Spend the day hiking

Hungarian born violinist, Bela Horvath began to play at age 3. In 1996,
Bela entered the Bela Bartok Conservatory and won a number of awards at the
renowned national violin competitions in Hungary. In 2000, he continued his
study of violin at the Franz Liszt University of Music. Two years later, in
2002, the renowned violinist, violist, and conductor, Pinchas Zukerman
invited Mr. Horvath to study with him and his associate, Patinka Kopec, at
the Manhattan School of Music in New York City.

During his studies in New York, Bela Horvath worked with the world’s
leading violinists and pedagogues such as Zakhar Bron, Leonidas Kavakos,
Jaime Laredo, Gyorgy Pauk among others. In 2003, he debuted in a Piano
Quartet recital at Carnegie Hall’s Weill Hall. He keeps a busy recital
schedule performing the *Chamber Orchestra on New York*
<https://chamberorchestraofnewyork.org/>and other collectives in Europe,
Canada, and the United States. Since 2009, Horvarth has been a faculty
member at the Manhattan School of Music’s Pre-college division program.

Carlos Avila; Photo by Pat Jarrett

Hailed for his “beautiful command of tone and mood…and unruffleable
savoir-faire” (San
Francisco Chronicle), his “layers of emotional expression” (The Examiner)
and his “level of
artistry that seem far beyond his years” (Contra Costa Times), Carlos Avila
is one of the most in-demand pianists on the classical music scene. His
concerts have taken him across North and South America, Europe, and Asia.

Avila began his professional career in 2001 and since then he has been a
guest at festivals such as Schleswig-Holstein, Tanglewood, Sarasota, Aspen,
Banff, Music Academy of the West, Pianofest, and many others. He had the
opportunity to work and study with the late Isaac Stern, Daniel Barenboim,
Michael Tilson Thomas, Emanuel Ax, Richard Goode and members of the St.
Lawrence, Tokyo, Guarneri, Juilliard, Ying, and Borodin String Quartets.
Avila was recently showcased on New York’s WQXR as one of the winners of
Juilliard’s prestigious Gina Bachauer Piano Competition.

A proud Filipino-American, Avila is a graduate of the Juilliard School
where he studied with Jerome Lowenthal and did prior studies at Yale with
Peter Frankl and Claude Frank.

Thank you Joanne! It is a real honor just to be nominated! I know I havent
been here that long, but meeting you and working with you in class has been
one of the best parts of my job. I would really appreciate it if you could
submit a short note for Sing Chun Lee and me - even a few sentences would
help us a lot. And thank you to all the faculty, staff, CAs, and TAs that
contributed materials and especially your time to support us. I wouldnt be
here without you!

PS. Maybe we can get Randall to buy a really nice lunch for the department
if CS sweeps the awards this year :)

Thank you!

Mike

Which PC were you trying to log into? This shows that your account is still fine, but the profile on that PC may be corrupted (which tends to happen a lot on multi-user windows systems). I'd like to remove your profile from that system to prevent the issue from happening again.

        Whenever I sign into my account in the lab I am given an error message that says "we can't sign into your account" and it tells me this will be fixed if i log out and log back in. However this does not work and it makes me unable to save files to my account.
         Could you help me out with any instructions on how to fix this?

    Hello,
    
    
    Whenever I sign into my account in the lab I am given an error message that says "we can't sign into your account" and it tells me this will be fixed if i log out and log back in. However this does not work and it makes me unable to save files to my account.
     Could you help me out with any instructions on how to fix this?

Announcement for Data Science and Data Visualization Position:

We are a multidisciplinary team working on developing a high-impact data analytics and visualization tool at Johns Hopkins Medicine. Our team is currently looking for students with data science and visualization skills/interests who are interested in working with real-world clinical data. No clinical knowledge is required. Candidates are expected to have experience in analyzing/visualizing data through their coursework or hands-on experience by using R and/or Python programming languages. Experience with time-series data analysis is a plus.

The experience you will gain on this project, given the scale of the dataset and the fact that it encompasses real-world clinical data, will be of tremendous value for your career in data science. We are flexible with work hours during the semester (Spring 2019), summer, and afterwards.

Interested candidates should send their resume to Ali Afshar (afshar@jhu.edu<mailto:afshar@jhu.edu>) at Johns Hopkins Medicine.

.D Tue, 12 Mar 2019 15:23:57 +0000
.M
Speaker: Tal Linzen, Johns Hopkins University
Date & Time: March 14,2019 at 10:30 am
Location: Hackerman B17
Title:
How well do neural NLP systems generalize?
Abstract:
Neural networks have rapidly become central to NLP systems. While such systems perform well on typical test set examples, their generalization abilities are often poorly understood. In this talk, I will discuss new methods to characterize the gaps between the abilities of neural systems and those of humans, by focusing on interpretable axes of generalization from the training set rather than on average test set performance. I will show that recurrent neural network (RNN) language models are able to process syntactic dependencies in typical sentences with considerable success, but when evaluated on more complex syntactically controlled materials, their error rate increases sharply. Likewise, neural systems trained to perform natural language inference generalize much more poorly than their test set performance would suggest. Finally, I will discuss a novel method for measuring compositionality in neural network representations; using this method, we show that the sentence representations acquired by neural natural language inference systems are not fully compositional, in line with their limited generalization abilities.
Bio:
Tal Linzen is an Assistant Professor of Cognitive Science at Johns Hopkins University. Before moving to Johns Hopkins in 2017, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, where he worked with Emmanuel Dupoux and Benjamin Spector; before that he obtained his PhD from the Department of Linguistics at New York University in 2015, under the supervision of Alec Marantz. At JHU, Dr. Linzen directs the Computation and Psycholinguistics Lab; the lab develops computational models of human language comprehension and acquisition, as well as methods for interpreting, evaluating and extending neural network models for natural language processing. The lab’s work has appeared in venues such as EMNLP, ICLR, NAACL and TACL, as well as in journals such as Cognitive Science and Journal of Neuroscience. Dr. Linzen is one of the co-organizers of the BlackboxNLP Workshop on Analyzing and Interpreting Neural Networks for NLP (EMNLP 2018, ACL 2019).

To keep a long story short, I was wondering if it would be possible for men's ultimate to practice next Thursday March 14 at night. We are willing to trade our Wednesday night March 13 830-10pm on Baseball spot, and we ask for us to be able to use the field March 14 8-9pm (we already have the field 9-10pm but we want to hold a full 2 hr practice that night). Would something like this work for you by any chance? Let me know if you have any questions.

All,
For those of you that are still looking for a research topic, or are looking for a dataset to work at, please consider these two web sites...
https://www.cfreds.nist.gov/drone-images.html
https://www.cfreds.nist.gov/
The first link is to 60 drone images.  You can make tools that carve for items, or you can use an existing carver (like Scalpel) to find items.  Or, you can just parse out the data.  Another option is to create a visualization from the data.
Good luck.
Tim

Just wanted to email Computer Science students, faculty, postdocs and staff to say (in case you haven't heard) I am retiring after 18 years at Hopkins (12 ½ years at CS).  My last day will be Friday, March 1, 2019.  I have thoroughly enjoyed working with all of you - it has been fun (for the most part - after all it was a "job"  ;-).  I have MANY pleasant memories of my time with the Computer Science Department which will last a lifetime.

I hope you all have enjoyed my candy guessing game over the years........the best part was when I got to read all the entries & giggled at some.......laughed at the ones that just had a number but no name......one time it was actually the winner - but there was no name on the paper.    LOVED IT!!!

Best wishes to all of you for a wonderful future and thank you for helping make my time at Computer Science a wonderful memory.
Debbie
