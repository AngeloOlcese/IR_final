Homewood Council on Inclusive Excellence
View this email in your browser (https://mailchi.mp/jhu/19-nom-hcie?e=a57d9a1452)
Message from the Dean
Dear Homewood faculty, students, and staff,

“Inclusive excellence” is the idea that we are at our very best when we abide by our core values in diversity, inclusion and equity. Here on the Homewood campus, we strive for a dynamic culture that enables full participation of each member of our community in research and education. In research, we arrive at better and more relevant solutions when we have input from people with different backgrounds, and in education, our inclusion serves to help create a diverse group of future leaders for our society.

The Homewood Council for Inclusive Excellence (http://hcie.jhu.edu)  (HCIE) advises us on matters of diversity, advocates for policies that foster an inclusive climate, identifies current practices that pose barriers to the engagement and success of underrepresented constituents, increases awareness of best practices, and implements innovations that advance our diversity goals outlined in the university’s Roadmap on Diversity and Inclusion (http://web.jhu.edu/administration/provost/diversity_roadmap) . The Council is led by KSAS Professor Rigoberto Hernandez and WSE Professor Jeff Gray and the Assistant Dean for Diversity and Inclusion, Darlene Saporu.

Over the past two years, the HCIE’s recommendations led to a pilot faculty mentoring workshop and new diversity modules for graduate student TA orientation. They engaged in discussions with campus leaders on admissions, family leave policies, and faculty hiring, and they provided input to us on emerging issues such as the campus police force.
To continue this work, we are seeking nominations of students, staff, and faculty (https://forms.gle/2a4TkKRwknTZ48rz5)  to serve on the council starting in the fall of 2019. Members serve terms of one to three years and commit to work with fellow HCIE members and stakeholders across campus. The Council strives to include a broad coalition of members representing campus constituencies. Self-nominations are accepted. We ask you to consider serving or nominating others who would contribute toward our mission of inclusive excellence on the Homewood Campus. Nominations may be submitted through May 20.

Sincerely,
Ed Schlesinger
Benjamin T. Rome Dean

Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff:

As you may know, on Tuesday, Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski announced his nomination of Melissa Hyatt as Baltimore County police chief. Melissa will officially step down from her role at Johns Hopkins in the coming weeks.

Over the past year as vice president for security for Johns Hopkins Medicine and Johns Hopkins University, Melissa has led the security operations of our institution with dedicated leadership and strong expertise. She has worked diligently to maintain the safety of our students, faculty, staff, clinicians, employees, patients, and visitors. While we are saddened by Melissa’s departure, we are grateful for her service and wish her well in her new role.

We are carefully considering the transition plan and will announce an interim leadership plan soon. Please join us in thanking Melissa for her leadership and service to JHM and JHU.

Sincerely,

Daniel G. Ennis
Senior Vice President for Finance and Administration
Johns Hopkins University

Robert Kasdin
Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer

.S Mourning the loss of a student in Computer Science
.D Thu, 9 May 2019 11:11:04 -0400
.M
Dear Computer Science Students, Faculty, and Staff,

It is with deep sadness that we write to inform you of the loss of one of
our students, Tianshi Liao, a computer science master's student in the
Whiting School of Engineering. Tianshi, who was from Guangzhou, China,
passed away on Friday, May 3. It was an accidental death and there is no
indication of any community safety concerns related to his passing.

Campus administrators have been in contact with his family to provide
support during this difficult time, and we convey our heartfelt condolences
to his family and friends for their terrible loss. Please keep them in your
thoughts in the days ahead.

Tianshi earned a bachelor of science in chemical engineering from China
University of Petroleum and a master of science in chemical engineering from
the University of Massachusetts, Lowell. Last month, he submitted a paper
entitled "Hierarchical Structural-Aware Deep Supervision" to the
International Conference on Computer Vision.  

His colleagues remember him as a team player, willing to help others when
needed, and a hard worker who developed his own ideas.  Tianshi was an
engaged athlete, enjoying tennis and badminton, and volunteering at the 2008
Olympic Games in Beijing.  

If you would like to express your condolences to the family, you may write
an email or letter to "The Family of Tianshi Liao" and send it to
<mailto:drobin79@jhu.edu> Diedre Robinson in the Whiting School of
Engineering Dean's Office, who will collect these messages on the family's
behalf.

When we lose a member of our community, some may find themselves in need of
support. Students may reach out to the Homewood Counseling Center at
410-516-8278. Outside of normal hours, the counselor on call may be reached
through Security at 410-516-7777. 

For members of our faculty and staff who are looking for support, the
Faculty and Staff Assistance Program (FASAP) provides private and
confidential services free of charge, including assessment, diagnosis, and
referral by FASAP clinicians; crisis intervention; brief treatment; and
training, education, and outreach. Please visit the

Together, we mourn the loss of such a promising member of our community.

Sincerely,

.D Thu, 2 May 2019 12:53:30 +0000

Speaker:  Vishal Patel, Johns Hopkins University
Date & Time: May 2, 2019 at 10:30 am
Location: Hackerman B17
Title: Deep Networks for Open Set Visual Recognition

Abstract:

Over the last five years, methods based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have shown impressive performance improvements for object detection and recognition problems. This has been made possible due to the availability of large annotated datasets, a better understanding of the non-linear mapping between input images and class labels as well as the affordability of GPUs. However, a vast majority of DCNN-based recognition methods are designed for a closed world, where the primary assumption is that all categories are known a priori. In many real-world applications, this assumption does not necessarily hold. In this talk, I will present some of my recent works on developing DCNN-based algorithms for open set recognition as well as novelty detection and one-class recognition. I will conclude my talk by describing several promising directions for future research.

Title: Deep Networks for Open Set Visual Recognition

Abstract:

Over the last five years, methods based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have shown impressive performance improvements for object detection and recognition problems. This has been made possible due to the availability of large annotated datasets, a better understanding of the non-linear mapping between input images and class labels as well as the affordability of GPUs. However, a vast majority of DCNN-based recognition methods are designed for a closed world, where the primary assumption is that all categories are known a priori. In many real-world applications, this assumption does not necessarily hold. In this talk, I will present some of my recent works on developing DCNN-based algorithms for open set recognition as well as novelty detection and one-class recognition. I will conclude my talk by describing several promising directions for future research.

Title: Scalable Graph Analysis and Clustering on Commodity Hardware

Abstract:
Today's large-scale datasets necessitate scalable data analysis frameworks and libraries. Traditional distributed memory solutions neglect optimizations for prevalent Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) architectures. Additionally, distributed memory solutions often solely rely on process-level parallelism and thus forgo shared and external memory optimizations, leading to suboptimal overall performance. This thesis explores the effects of NUMA-awareness and fine-grain I/O optimizations from SSDs to improve hardware minimality, scalability and memory parallelism in graph analytics and community detection. Our computation optimizations target data that reside either (i) in-memory, (ii) semi-externally, or (iii) in distributed memory. We first present Graphyti, a semi-external memory graph library built on the FlashGraph framework to demonstrate key design principles for vertex-centric, semi-external memory (SEM) graph applications. Graphyti on a single thick node achieves comparable performance to popular distributed graph libraries in a cluster. We then address web-scale community detection and present the clusterNOR framework. We advance the state-of-the-art for memory parallel NUMA computation of k-means and subsequently clustering algorithms that follow the Majorize-Minimization/Minorize-Maximization (MM) objective function optimization pattern. clusterNOR introduces semi-external memory I/O optimizations and cache friendly NUMA scheduling policies for both hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering algorithms. We demonstrate how these optimizations lead to performance improvements of up to an order magnitude over state-of-the-art clustering frameworks.

Title: Oblique Sparse Projection Forest Optimization: A Faster Randomer Forest


Abstract:
The proliferation of scientific and industrial sensors is causing an accelerating deluge of data the processing of which into actionable knowledge requires fast and accurate machine learning methods. A class of algorithms suited to process these large amounts of data is decision forests, widely used methods known for their versatility, state of the art inference, and fast model training.
Oblique Sparse Projection Forests - OSPFs - are a subset of decision forests, which provide data inference superior to other methods.  Despite providing state of the art inference and having a computational complexity similar to other popular decision forests, there are no SPF implementations that scale beyond trivially sized datasets.

We  explore  whether  OSPF  training  and  inference  speeds  can  compete with other popular decision forest variants despite an algorithmic incompatibility which prevent OSPFs from using traditional forest training optimizations. First, using R, we implement a highly extensible proof of concept version of a recently conceived OSPF, Randomer Forest, shown to provide state
of the art results on many datasets and provide this system for general use via CRAN. We then develop and implement a postprocessing method, Forest Packing, to pack the nodes of a trained forest into a novel data structure and modify the ensemble traversal method to accelerate forest based inferences. Finally, we develop FastRerF, an optimized version of Randomer Forest which dynamically performs forest packing during training.

The initial implementation in R provided training speeds in line with other decision forest systems and scaled better with additional resources, but used an excessive amount of memory and provided slow inference speeds.  The development  of  Forest  Packing  increased  inference  throughput  by  almost an order of magnitude as compared to other systems while greatly reducing prediction latency.  FastRerF model training is faster than other popular decision forest systems when using similar parameters and trains Random Forests faster than the current state of the art.  Overall, we provide data scientists a novel OSPF system with R and Python front ends, which trains and
predicts faster than other decision forest implementations.

Dear Faculty, Students, and Staff:
In 2013, we laid out an ambitious set of goals for the university to achieve by the end of the decade—the Ten by Twenty. With input from and consultation with members of the JHU community, we pushed ourselves to aim high.
As we approach 2020, we are not only reaching even further but redefining what’s possible for us to accomplish together. In this, our third Ten by Twenty progress report (https://10x2020progress.jhu.edu/2019/?utm_source=JHU+Broadcast+Messages+-+Synced+List&utm_campaign=91cc48dc91-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_25_06_47_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_9cf4956bf9-91cc48dc91-69746085&mc_cid=91cc48dc91&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) , we mark our successes through 2018 and share the many ways in which our university is striving to advance core priorities.
Since our last progress report, we have broken records for faculty hiring and research support, pushed the boundaries of space exploration, and increased access to a Hopkins education thanks to extraordinary support for financial aid that now places Johns Hopkins in the pantheon of great universities that are permanently need-blind and no-loan. Our momentum is also building with the launch of interdisciplinary centers for learning and health care, and new tools for student, faculty, and staff success.
We are humbled by all that the Hopkins community has accomplished since the start of the Ten by Twenty, and excited about what’s in store in its final two years as we make new investments in sustainability, a long-awaited student center, and a new home for Hopkins programs in the heart of the nation’s capital.
I invite you to explore this report and share your thoughts on ways we can deepen and extend our impact by 2020 and beyond.

Sincerely,
Ronald J. Daniels

Title: Oblique Sparse Projection Forest Optimization: A Faster Randomer Forest


Abstract:
The proliferation of scientific and industrial sensors is causing an accelerating deluge of data the processing of which into actionable knowledge requires fast and accurate machine learning methods. A class of algorithms suited to process these large amounts of data is decision forests, widely used methods known for their versatility, state of the art inference, and fast model training.
Oblique Sparse Projection Forests - OSPFs - are a subset of decision forests, which provide data inference superior to other methods.  Despite providing state of the art inference and having a computational complexity similar to other popular decision forests, there are no SPF implementations that scale beyond trivially sized datasets.

We  explore  whether  OSPF  training  and  inference  speeds  can  compete with other popular decision forest variants despite an algorithmic incompatibility which prevent OSPFs from using traditional forest training optimizations. First, using R, we implement a highly extensible proof of concept version of a recently conceived OSPF, Randomer Forest, shown to provide state
of the art results on many datasets and provide this system for general use via CRAN. We then develop and implement a postprocessing method, Forest Packing, to pack the nodes of a trained forest into a novel data structure and modify the ensemble traversal method to accelerate forest based inferences. Finally, we develop FastRerF, an optimized version of Randomer Forest which dynamically performs forest packing during training.

The initial implementation in R provided training speeds in line with other decision forest systems and scaled better with additional resources, but used an excessive amount of memory and provided slow inference speeds.  The development  of  Forest  Packing  increased  inference  throughput  by  almost an order of magnitude as compared to other systems while greatly reducing prediction latency.  FastRerF model training is faster than other popular decision forest systems when using similar parameters and trains Random Forests faster than the current state of the art.  Overall, we provide data scientists a novel OSPF system with R and Python front ends, which trains and
predicts faster than other decision forest implementations.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dear Patient,
Many of you have expressed concern about the recent measles epidemic and your risk
of contracting the disease.  If you know as a fact that you have previously had 
measles, then you are immune.  If you are uncertain, our recommendation at this 
time is that you obtain an MMR blood test to test for immunity to the measles virus.
 If the blood test shows low immunity, then you should receive one booster of MMR
vaccine.  Please see below for the CDC published MMR vaccine side effects.
PLEASE BE AWARE THAT BOTH THE BLOOD TEST AND THE VACCINE MAY NOT BE COVERED BY INSURANCE.
As always, your health and the heath of your loved ones is our primary concern.
Sincerely,
The Doctors and Staff at Maple Medical
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MMR Vaccine Side Effects
The MMR vaccine is very safe, and it is effective at preventing measles, mumps, 
and rubella. Vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects. Most people who
 get MMR vaccine do not have any serious problems with it. Getting MMR vaccine is
much safer than getting measles, mumps or rubella.
Common Side Effects of MMR Vaccine:

* Sore arm from the shot
* Fever
* Mild rash
* Temporary pain and stiffness in the joints, mostly in teenage or adult women who
did not already have immunity to the rubella component of the vaccine
MMR vaccine has been linked with a very small risk of febrile seizures (seizures
 or jerking caused by fever). Febrile seizures following MMR are rare and are not
associated with any long-term effects. Because the risk of febrile seizures increases
as infants get older, it is recommended that they get vaccinated as soon as recommended.
Some people may experience swelling in the cheeks or neck. MMR vaccine rarely causes
a temporary low platelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder that usually
 goes away without treatment and is not life threatening.
Extremely rarely, a person may have a serious allergic reaction to MMR vaccine. 
Anyone who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to the antibiotic neomycin,
or any other component of MMR vaccine, should not get the vaccine.

.D Wed, 17 Apr 2019 19:39:21 +0000

Speaker:  Ke Li, UC Berkeley
Date & Time: April 18, 2019 at 10:30 am
Location: Hackerman B17
Title: Nearest Neighbour Search and Generative Modelling

Abstract:

Machine learning is subject to the limits of computation, and advances in algorithms can open up new possibilities for machine learning. The problem of nearest neighbour search arises commonly in machine learning; unfortunately, despite over 40 years of research, prior sublinear algorithms for exact nearest neighbour search suffer from the curse of dimensionality, that is, an exponential dependence of query time complexity on either the ambient or the intrinsic dimensionality. In the first part of this talk, I will present Dynamic Continuous Indexing (DCI), a new family of exact randomized algorithms that avoids exponential dependence on both the ambient and the intrinsic dimensionality. This advance enables us to develop a new method for generative modelling, known as Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE), which I will present in the second part of the talk. IMLE can be shown to be equivalent to maximum likelihood under some conditions and simultaneously overcomes three fundamental issues of generative adversarial nets (GANs), namely mode collapse, vanishing gradients and training instability. I will illustrate why mode collapse happens in GANs and how IMLE overcomes it, and also demonstrate empirical results on image synthesis. I will close off with a brief discussion of another approach I introduced, known as Learning to Optimize.

Bio:

Ke Li is a Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley advised by Prof. Jitendra Malik. He is interested in a broad range of topics in machine learning, and also enjoys working on computer vision, natural language processing and algorithms. He is particularly passionate about tackling long-standing fundamental problems that cannot be tackled with a straightforward application of conventional techniques. He received his Hon. B.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Toronto and is grateful for the support of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).

.D Tue, 16 Apr 2019 16:00:38 +0000
.M
Speaker:  Ke Li, UC Berkeley
Date & Time: April 18, 2019 at 10:30 am
Location: Hackerman B17
Title: Nearest Neighbour Search and Generative Modelling

Abstract:

Machine learning is subject to the limits of computation, and advances in algorithms can open up new possibilities for machine learning. The problem of nearest neighbour search arises commonly in machine learning; unfortunately, despite over 40 years of research, prior sublinear algorithms for exact nearest neighbour search suffer from the curse of dimensionality, that is, an exponential dependence of query time complexity on either the ambient or the intrinsic dimensionality. In the first part of this talk, I will present Dynamic Continuous Indexing (DCI), a new family of exact randomized algorithms that avoids exponential dependence on both the ambient and the intrinsic dimensionality. This advance enables us to develop a new method for generative modelling, known as Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE), which I will present in the second part of the talk. IMLE can be shown to be equivalent to maximum likelihood under some conditions and simultaneously overcomes three fundamental issues of generative adversarial nets (GANs), namely mode collapse, vanishing gradients and training instability. I will illustrate why mode collapse happens in GANs and how IMLE overcomes it, and also demonstrate empirical results on image synthesis. I will close off with a brief discussion of another approach I introduced, known as Learning to Optimize.

Bio:

Ke Li is a Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley advised by Prof. Jitendra Malik. He is interested in a broad range of topics in machine learning, and also enjoys working on computer vision, natural language processing and algorithms. He is particularly passionate about tackling long-standing fundamental problems that cannot be tackled with a straightforward application of conventional techniques. He received his Hon. B.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Toronto and is grateful for the support of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).

Summer research project opportunities

Our group at the Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare is working on projects that utilize computer science areas like machine learning, crowdsourcing and virtual reality simulation to improve surgery training and assessment. Our projects are multidisciplinary in nature and include clinical and education collaborators in addition to computer science and engineering investigators. There are a lot of projects underway in the space of colonoscopy procedures, cataract surgery, head and neck surgery, robot-assisted surgery, and simulation-based training using virtual reality. Finally, these projects have various components that can range from sophisticated computer programming needs to very low level programming knowledge. Please write an email to both of us Anand Malpani (anandmalpani@jhu.edu<mailto:anandmalpani@jhu.edu>) and Swaroop Vedula (swaroop@jhu.edu<mailto:swaroop@jhu.edu>) with the following details:

  1.  Resume
  2.  Relevant courses and projects if any
  3.  1-2 sentences indicating why you are interested in this work

Speaker:  Avrim Blum, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago
Date & Time: April 16,2019 at 10:30 am
Location: Hackerman B17
Title:  "Algorithmic fairness in Online Decision-making"
Abstract:
There is growing concern about fairness in algorithmic decision making: Are algorithmic decisions treating different groups fairly? How can we make them fairer? What do we even mean by fair? In this talk I will discuss some of our work on this topic, focusing on the setting of online decision making. For instance, a classic result states that given a collection of predictors, one can adaptively combine them to perform nearly as well as the best of those predictors in hindsight (achieve "no regret") without any stochastic assumptions. Can one extend this guarantee so that if the predictors are themselves fair (according to a given definition), then the overall combination is fair as well (according to the same definition)? I will discuss this and other issues. This is joint work with Suriya Gunasekar, Thodoris Lykouris, and Nati Srebro.
Bio:
Professor Blum's main research interests are in Theoretical Computer Science and Machine Learning, including Machine Learning Theory, Approximation Algorithms, Algorithmic Game Theory, and Database Privacy, as well as connections among them. Some current specific interests include multi-agent learning, multi-task learning, semi-supervised learning, and the design of incentive systems. He is also known for his past work in Al Planning. Prof. Blum has served as Program Chair for the IEE Symposium and Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) and the Conference on Learing Theory (COLT). He has served as Chair of the ACM SIGACT Committee for the Advancement of Theoretical Computer Science and on the SIGACT Executive Committee.

.D Mon, 15 Apr 2019 13:29:37 +0000
.M
Speaker:  Avrim Blum, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago
Date & Time: April 16,2019 at 10:30 am
Location: Hackerman B17
Title:  "Algorithmic fairness in Online Decision-making"
Abstract:
There is growing concern about fairness in algorithmic decision making: Are algorithmic decisions treating different groups fairly? How can we make them fairer? What do we even mean by fair? In this talk I will discuss some of our work on this topic, focusing on the setting of online decision making. For instance, a classic result states that given a collection of predictors, one can adaptively combine them to perform nearly as well as the best of those predictors in hindsight (achieve "no regret") without any stochastic assumptions. Can one extend this guarantee so that if the predictors are themselves fair (according to a given definition), then the overall combination is fair as well (according to the same definition)? I will discuss this and other issues. This is joint work with Suriya Gunasekar, Thodoris Lykouris, and Nati Srebro.
Bio:
Professor Blum's main research interests are in Theoretical Computer Science and Machine Learning, including Machine Learning Theory, Approximation Algorithms, Algorithmic Game Theory, and Database Privacy, as well as connections among them. Some current specific interests include multi-agent learning, multi-task learning, semi-supervised learning, and the design of incentive systems. He is also known for his past work in Al Planning. Prof. Blum has served as Program Chair for the IEE Symposium and Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) and the Conference on Learing Theory (COLT). He has served as Chair of the ACM SIGACT Committee for the Advancement of Theoretical Computer Science and on the SIGACT Executive Committee.

http://www.jhu.edu?utm_source=JHU+Broadcast+Messages+-+Synced+List&utm_campaign=be566bdcc4-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_04_09_07_26&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_9cf4956bf9-be566bdcc4-69746085&mc_cid=be566bdcc4&mc_eid=[UNIQID]

Dear Faculty, Students, and Staff:

Over the past several months, we have shared updates with the university community highlighting the composition of our faculty, the work of our Office of Institutional Equity, and the promising results of our three-year economic inclusion program, HopkinsLocal. These vital initiatives, taking place across the university and in partnership with leaders and neighbors across Baltimore City, reflect Johns Hopkins’ sustained commitment to engaging fully a diversity of people, backgrounds, experiences, and thought. Such diversity is fundamental to our mission and to the university’s continued excellence.

Today, we release our second progress report on the JHU Roadmap on Diversity and Inclusion (https://diversity.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Roadmap-Progress-Report-2019.pdf?utm_source=JHU+Broadcast+Messages+-+Synced+List&utm_campaign=be566bdcc4-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_04_09_07_26&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_9cf4956bf9-be566bdcc4-69746085&mc_cid=be566bdcc4&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) , with current information on the broad array of work and actions that are underway to advance diversity and inclusion across our campuses. This update also supports the promise we made when we launched the Roadmap in 2016: to be transparent and accountable as we work toward our ambitious goals.

Among the highlights of the report:
* The extraordinary $1.8 billion gift from Michael Bloomberg to support undergraduate financial aid had an immediate impact after its announcement last fall, allowing us to launch and accelerate efforts to recruit diverse students from every socioeconomic background and to ensure they have access to comprehensive support and opportunities when they arrive on campus.

* We published our second Faculty Composition report, detailing the racial, ethnic, and gender composition of our faculty to the departmental level. The report differentiates between underrepresented minority (URM) faculty, who identify as part of racial or ethnic groups that have traditionally been underrepresented within higher education, including black or African-American, Hispanic, American Indian, or Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and minority faculty, which encompasses the URM categories plus individuals identifying as Asian.
The report, based on November 2017 data, provides key snapshots and comparisons against our own first progress report and peer institutions. We are encouraged that our overall faculty growth rate (5%) was surpassed by our growth rate in female professorial faculty (13%), minority professorial faculty (11%), and URM professorial faculty (18%). And while there is still significant work ahead, we are pleased to see universitywide increases in female faculty (from 42% to 44%), in all minority faculty (from 30% to 32%), and in URM faculty (from 8% to 9%).

* Later this spring, we will be publishing our first Staff Composition Report, which is similar to our faculty (https://provost.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/03/Report-on-Faculty-Composition-2019.pdf?utm_source=JHU+Broadcast+Messages+-+Synced+List&utm_campaign=be566bdcc4-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_04_09_07_26&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_9cf4956bf9-be566bdcc4-69746085&mc_cid=be566bdcc4&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) and graduate student (http://web.jhu.edu/administration/provost/reports_resources/JHU%20Report%20on%20Graduate%20School%20Diversity.pdf//?utm_source=JHU+Broadcast+Messages+-+Synced+List&utm_campaign=be566bdcc4-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_04_09_07_26&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_9cf4956bf9-be566bdcc4-69746085&mc_cid=be566bdcc4&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) composition reports and underscores an enhanced focus on staff diversity.

* The Faculty Diversity Initiative (FDI), now in its fourth year, continues to support our efforts to recruit diverse faculty and to build out the systems and processes needed to retain and bolster the development of all faculty. Between 2016 (the first year of the FDI) and 2018, the percentage of new faculty hires who identified as underrepresented minorities (URM) was relatively consistent (10.5% and 10.8%, respectively), while the rate of departures for URM faculty fell by nearly half (from 9.5% to 4.9%).

* We expanded health benefits for students, providing many with lower deductibles for health care, new options for dental and vision coverage, and improved mental health coverage. We broadened the university’s child care benefit to include residents, interns, and full-time doctoral students or postdocs. And for employees, we further expanded family-support benefits and the Employee Assistance Program, and have focused on enhanced outreach to increase the understanding and use of available benefits.

* We are updating the university’s foundational diversity statements and policies—specifically, Johns Hopkins’ Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity Statement, and a new Discrimination and Harassment Policy and Procedures—to reflect a contemporary and shared understanding of our community’s values and expectations. Both will be released this spring.

* We published our first annual report of the Office of Institutional Equity in fall 2018, providing background and specific data on our response to reports of sexual misconduct and other forms of discrimination and harassment.

* We met our three-year goals for the HopkinsLocal economic inclusion program, committing 23.5 percent of our addressable construction spending to minority-owned, women-owned, and disadvantaged businesses; hiring 1,017 people from distressed city ZIP codes into targeted positions; and increasing our spending with local suppliers by $54.3 million. We also committed to launching the second round of this important program this summer.

Since the adoption of the JHU Roadmap on Diversity and Inclusion in 2016, the commitment of our students, staff, faculty, and divisional leadership to this effort—and the continued focus of our board of trustees—has allowed us to make significant progress in a number of key areas, from faculty recruitment and retention to local economic inclusion. Our work, however, is far from complete and our commitments are not static. Over the past year alone, our community has engaged passionately around issues such as safety and security, disability services, and federal immigration policy—all of which implicate principles at the core of the Roadmap. We must continue to embrace these debates and ensure our values drive our responses to these and many other important concerns.

We look forward to the work ahead and hope you will read the report and continue to share your feedback and ideas through the diversity.jhu.eduwebsite or by emailing diversityroadmap@jhu.edu (mailto:diversityroadmap@jhu.edu) .

Sincerely,

Title:  "Algorithmic fairness in Online Decision-making"
Abstract:
There is growing concern about fairness in algorithmic decision making: Are algorithmic decisions treating different groups fairly? How can we make them fairer? What do we even mean by fair? In this talk I will discuss some of our work on this topic, focusing on the setting of online decision making. For instance, a classic result states that given a collection of predictors, one can adaptively combine them to perform nearly as well as the best of those predictors in hindsight (achieve "no regret") without any stochastic assumptions. Can one extend this guarantee so that if the predictors are themselves fair (according to a given definition), then the overall combination is fair as well (according to the same definition)? I will discuss this and other issues. This is joint work with Suriya Gunasekar, Thodoris Lykouris, and Nati Srebro.

Title: Building Hierarchical Storage Services in the Cloud

Abstract:
Object storage has emerged as a low-cost and scalable alternative solution in the cloud for storing unstructured data. However, performance limitations often compel users to employ supplementary storage services for their varied workloads. The result is growing storage sprawl, unacceptably low performance, and an increase in associated storage costs. We combine the assets of multiple cloud service on offer to develop NDStore, a scalable multi-hierarchical data storage deployment for open-science data in the cloud. It utilizes object storage as scalable base tier and an in-memory cluster as a low-latency caching tier to support a variety of workloads.
Moreover, many applications that are reliant on richer file system APIs and semantics are unable to benefit from object storage. Users either transfer data between a file system and object storage or use inefficient file connectors over object stores. One promising solution to this problem is providing dual access, the ability to transparently read and write the same data through both, file system interfaces and object storage APIs. We discuss features which we believe are essential or desirable in a dual-access object storage file system-OSFS. Further, we design and implement Agni, an efficient dual-access OSFS, utilizing only standard object storage APIs and capabilities. Generic object storage's lack of support for partial writes introduces a performance penalty for some workloads. Agni overcomes this shortcomings by implementing a multi-tier data structure which temporally indexes partial writes from the file system, persists them to a log, and merges them asynchronously for eventually consistent access through the object interface. Our experiments demonstrate that Agni improves partial write performance by two to seven times with minimal indexing overhead and for some representative workloads it can improve performance by 20%- 60% compared to S3FS, a popular OSFS, or the prevalent approach of manually copying data between different storage systems.
