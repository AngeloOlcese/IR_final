Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff:

Early this morning, we made the difficult decision to call upon local fire and police personnel to help our university bring an end to the lengthy occupation of Garland Hall by students and outside activists, a situation that had become increasingly unsafe.

Over these past five weeks, the university made every effort to accommodate the underlying protest because we hold so firmly to the belief in free expression. But what began as a demonstration against university policies in recent days took a turn, as students and outside activists chained the doors closed, blocked exits and entrances to the building, harassed and intimidated our staff, and physically prevented fellow students from receiving essential services. This was no longer a peaceful show of civil disobedience, but instead a forcible occupation of a university building in contravention of the law and university code of conduct.

In the intervening days, we worked around the clock to bring the occupation to a constructive conclusion. We made open-ended offers to meet and provide amnesty to our students. We also undertook an intensive effort to communicate with student protesters, directly and through their families, friends, and mentors. While some student protesters were receptive to these overtures; others regrettably were not.

Invoking the help of law enforcement in ending an occupation involving our students is—and must always be—a last resort, one that we took today only in the face of mounting safety concerns and untenable disruption of essential student services and university activities.

Our job now is to redouble our efforts to forge connections across even seemingly intractable divides, working together to create opportunities for genuine dialogue, and to deepen our understanding of the important issues we face as a university. We are truly grateful to everyone in our community who strives toward those ends and who worked diligently and selflessly to bring us to a safe resolution today.

Sincerely,

Ronald J. Daniels
President

Sunil Kumar
Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs

Dear Faculty, Students, and Staff:

Nine years ago this spring, with the global community facing increasing threats from climate change, Johns Hopkins University made an ambitious pledge to reduce its carbon emissions by 51 percent by 2025. We are excited to share significant progress toward that goal and the new steps we are taking to build a sustainable future.

Under an agreement with Constellation announced today (https://hub.jhu.edu/2019/04/22/constellation-agreement-solar-energy/?utm_source=JHU+Broadcast+Messages+-+Synced+List&utm_campaign=0904b5f303-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_04_22_02_19&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_9cf4956bf9-0904b5f303-69746085&mc_cid=0904b5f303&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) , Johns Hopkins will be buying 253,000 megawatt hours of solar power a year starting in 2021, a move that will significantly offset the carbon emissions from our Maryland and Washington campuses. This purchase, one of the largest of its kind among institutions of higher education, will enable us to hit our 51 percent target on schedule, cutting our carbon emissions by 123,000 metric tons in the first year alone.

This move also represents a key next step in our comprehensive effort to advance sustainable solutions at our university—investing in cogeneration on our campuses, increasing use of renewable energy sources, making efficiency gains, and pursuing a bold research agenda.

Since 2009, we have launched new centers for learning on sustainability, including our cross-divisional Department of Environmental Health & Engineering. We have spent more than $80 million in energy conserving infrastructure—constructing cogeneration plants at the Homewood and East Baltimore campuses, installing thousands of solar panels across our Baltimore facilities, and building LEED-certified labs and learning spaces. We have made marked efficiency gains in our lighting, vehicle fleet, and central plant operations. And in the last academic year, after hearing from students and weighing how best to balance our fiduciary obligations and our environmental stewardship, we decided with the full support of our trustees to divest from thermal coal in any of the university endowment’s separately managed holdings, an uncommon step among our peer universities.

Reaching our 2025 emissions reduction goal does not mean that our efforts to fight climate change cease. There is more that we believe we can do to build a sustainable future at Johns Hopkins, and this requires input and expertise from across our divisions. For this reason, we are launching today a new universitywide Sustainability Leadership Council. The SLC is charged with providing advice and recommendations to the provost on policies, programs, and other initiatives that will build a greater role for Johns Hopkins in teaching, research, and leadership on environmental sustainability, both locally and globally. It is also tasked with amplifying Johns Hopkins’ research and practice around environmental sustainability, through fostering academic collaboration and supporting the work of the Office of Sustainability.

The SLC will be co-chaired by Bob McLean, vice president for facilities and real estate, and Peter Winch, a professor in the Social and Behavioral Interventions Program at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. Its members will include representatives from each of the university’s schools and divisions and from each registered student group with a relevant environmental focus. To apply to join this committee or to nominate others, please contact provost@jhu.edu.

To turn many of the SLC’s recommendations into action, we will rely upon our Office of Sustainability.  We are excited to welcome Julian Goresko as our new director of Sustainability. Julian comes to Johns Hopkins from the University of Pennsylvania, where he helped with the launch and implementation of its Climate Action Plan 2.0. Julian’s work will complement, through university operations and outreach, the outstanding research, teaching, and advocacy being done by our faculty and students.

All of these steps—our expanded renewable energy commitment, our new model for advancing sustainability efforts universitywide, and dedicated leadership through the Office of Sustainability—demonstrate our commitment to combat global climate change and protect the long-term health of our planet. The fulfillment of these promises is impossible without the sustained contributions from all members of the university community. We value your efforts to bring us closer to our goals and push us to aim ever higher.

We look forward to working with you to make Johns Hopkins a global leader in environmental stewardship.

Sincerely,

Ronald J. Daniels

A CAMPFIRE-WORTHY STORY

Let us tell you a little story about our wood designs. VC's CEO, Adriana, loves an old wood cabin, warm wood-burning fireplace or pretty much anything that involves being outdoors. When fleshing out design ideas for our summer 2018 events, it was therefore no surprise that we created quite a few wood-themed jerseys.

The shocking surprise was that not everyone loves wood designs as much as she does. We're not sure if it's simply because we made A LOT of them, or if the design takes a special (extremely evolved) taste to appreciate... but we have a lot of stock left (like, a lot... don't tell Adriana how many).

WORLD ULTIMATE CHAMPIONSHIPS

USAU MASTERS CHAMPIONSHIPS

CANADIAN ULTIMATE CHAMPIONSHIPS

So, lucky for you, these wood design jerseys are available at unbelievably low price. We want them out in the world. We think they will spread joy.

This season, we introduced the Spin Ascent Women's College Sponsorship with the goal of inviting a small number of college women's programs to work with us on something special.  Rather than just offer inexpensive uniforms (though, let's be real--that's part of it), our goal was to build long term relationships where we could support our Ascent teams and players, foster community-building within the women's college game, and support the growth of women's Ultimate in general.

We are proud to be working with three teams in our inaugural season: Florida FUEL, Michigan Flywheel, and UCLA BLU.

During the season, we've partnered with some organizations you know and love like  UltiWorld [https://ultiworld.com/2019/02/22/spin-stories-inside-look-fuel-flywheel-blu-part-1/] and  UltiPhotos [https://www.ultiphotos.com/] to help raise the teams' profiles and also to offer an in-depth understanding of what it means not only to play women's ultimate, but to be among the best.

Here's a brief look at each team:

Florida FUEL [https://www.instagram.com/fuelenfuego/]: Goals for this season include showing relentless positivity, playing every point like it's game point, and making it to Nationals for the third year in a row.

Michigan Flywheel [https://www.flywheelultimate.com/]: Flywheel is working to foster exceptional team chemistry, prove they're the hardest working team on the field, and train themselves to be better mentally and physically.

UCLA BLU [https://www.instagram.com/bruinladiesultimate/]: Focused on developing chemistry on a team with 11 new players, BLU is eager to return to Nationals this year. Along the way, they're aiming to reestablish their spot as a top team in a highly competitive region

And finally, please support these organizations who have inspired us to try do our part:   Without Limits [http://withoutlimitsultimate.com/],  USAU Girls' Ultimate Movement [http://gum.usaultimate.org/],  and  Premier Ultimate League [https://www.premierultimateleague.com/].

Ordered some sweet gear from us and want to share it with friends, family, and alumni? Or perhaps collecting order information and money from teammates is a huge hassle? Well then let us set up a team store for you!

You can also use a team store as a fundraiser for your team! We'll share a portion of the proceeds from the orders with you.

GO VELVET OR GO HOME

We at VC Ultimate have recently celebrated three huge, successful milestones : the introduction of our new non-binary raglan jersey, the launch of our new recycled FlexLight material, and the incredible Premier Ultimate League sponsorship campaign. Not being ones to rest on our laurels, we're excited to keep moving forward and introduce your new favourite cold-weather piece – just in time for April tryouts in our cold Canadian climate – the Velvet long sleeve jersey.

YOU'LL NEVER WANT TO TAKE IT OFF!

The Velvet long sleeve jersey features the same raglan cut as our non-binary jersey, only in a long sleeve version. Our new exclusive velvet fabric features just the right amount of stretch, warmth and softness to make this jersey one you'll never want to take off!

This is one piece that's created a lot of buzz around the office, and we know you'll love it as much as we do!

Our first shipment of this new fabric is expected to be delivered on Monday April 1st, and will be available for custom orders shortly!

INTRODUCING THE BRAND NEW HOLI RAGLAN

Not only is this jersey, well, gorgeous... it's also inclusive. Our non-binary Raglan jersey is cut to fit a body type, not a gender.

Check out the sizing chart to see if this jersey is a good fit for you - and, don't worry, we offer free returns on this style!

A CELEBRATION OF COLOUR!

This design was inspired by the beautiful colours of the Holi festival. Holi is considered one of the most revered and celebrated festivals of India, and it is celebrated in almost every part of the country. It is also sometimes called the “festival of love” since on this day people unite, and forget resentments and all types of bad feeling towards each other.  https://www.holifestival.org [https://www.holifestival.org/]

We also celebrate two new resources: the Makerspace at FastForward U (https://ventures.jhu.edu/makerspace-fastforward-u-projects-whiting/) and the new Graduate Student Award (https://ventures.jhu.edu/fast-forward-u-grad-student-award-winners-2018/ ) .

TERENCE CRAWFORD
Omaha, Nebraska
34-0 (25 KOs)VS.AMIR KHAN
Bolton, England
33-4 (20 KOs)


World Championship Boxing returns to Madison Square Garden on Saturday, April 20thas two of the sport&rsquo;s biggest stars face off in the year&rsquo;s most anticipated welterweight showdown when TERENCE &ldquo;Bud&rdquo; CRAWFORD puts his WBO Welterweight World Title on the line against the pride of Bolton, England, AMIR &ldquo;King&rdquo; KHAN.


Crawford (34-0, 25 KOs), is ranked by many experts as the world’s best fighter, a switch-hitting dynamo who has reigned supreme in three weight classes.  Crawford made history when he unified all four 140-pound titles in 2017 before moving up to Welterweight.


Khan (33-4, 20 KOs), at 17 years of age, captured a silver medal for Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. The lightning quick former unified 140-pound champion has won seven of his last eight bouts as he prepares to take on the pound-for-pound king in a legacy-defining superfight.
