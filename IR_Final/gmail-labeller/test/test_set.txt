Everybody needs to sign up to bring something to frisbee Thanksgiving here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SVJyBmwYMWeVedOO2S8TZUNAC0KCHwid9ZGgImmJK-0/edit?usp=sharing If you haven’t already, please text Alex Lindsay your name (734-516-8577).

>> Option 2)  Make something (where I mean "make" loosely)! If you don't cook, some shit can be easy enough to learn in one go on the web. We've used Cooking for Engineers in the past. It's even easier to buy a bunch of dinner rolls or cornbread and put it on a big platter (We legitimately need someone to do these, sign up). Good vegetables are often underrepresented, and how much easier can you get than carrots or broccoli or some shit? Also note you don't need to bring something "traditional". Do you make a mean/special grilled cheese? Or does your family always buy a few cans of pearled onions that apparently other families don't do (<-me)? Go for it.

>> Option 3) Become somebody's helper/duplicate. If someone else seems to be making a dish that may have a high time or monetary buy-in, ask if they want help. Help out in the kitchen, and give some cash. Maybe learn a senior's signature dish so it can be here next year. In my opinion, cooking alone is the wrong approach to Frisbee Thanksgiving, company is much more fun. If you currently plan to cook alone, maybe ask if someone else has the space for you to cook in the same place as them. On another note, sometimes when people say they will make some staple like mashed potatoes they're not planning to make the whole amount that's needed to feed 30-50 people. So definitely speak to the important dish-makers if you're still searching for a role. Preparing for this event may require you to talk to others on the team you may not have gotten the chance to know yet; In fact, that's a crucial part of the holiday.

Could ask Bobby to see if we can do a weekend event. And get field space
for it. We do have open practices from now till the 12th I believe. It
would be hard to do it after a practice as we have practices from 9-11pm.

I would put Bob and Ben in charge of this if we want to make it an event.
They'll have the sports club connections to see what field space we can get
outside of normal practice times. I'll push it in the groupme once details
are finalized and maybe guys can post in support of it as well.

Shank- is rutgers having an event open for everyone next week? this years
focus is youth....maybe making an event for it at the end of practice,
pushing more youth players from devyl out there, and then tweet a picture

Hello All:

To piggy back off of the last email, please see the following link for
GPP:
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScnkNaX9IBuTd1FZlSHevC1Ml7wUdYH3RnshE7SOIWLPkYCBA/viewform?usp=sf_link

At this point, there have only been 12 responses, and even if you do not
plan on doing it (which I personally believe you should if you want to buy
into the culture and progression of this team), please fill out the
participation sheet.

We need to know how many are planning are participating and how many are
planning on not participating.

Hello again!

I hope everybody’s thanksgivings were awesome and much food was consumed! Reminder to sign up make some food or help a friend make something! (The link to the spreadsheet is here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SVJyBmwYMWeVedOO2S8TZUNAC0KCHwid9ZGgImmJK-0/edit?usp=sharing) Also text 734-516-8577 (Alex Lindsay) or email jhudangerzone@gmail.com your name if you plan to come! Your name is important as you will be put on a list that the AMR I security will get and they will let you in at the gate when you show ID. Thanks again!

Good vegetables are often underrepresented, and how much easier can you get than carrots or broccoli or some shit? Also note you don't need to bring something "traditional". Do you make a mean/special grilled cheese? Or does your family always buy a few cans of pearled onions that apparently other families don't do (<-me)? Go for it.

Help out in the kitchen, and give some cash. Maybe learn a senior's signature dish so it can be here next year. In my opinion, cooking alone is the wrong approach to Frisbee Thanksgiving, company is much more fun. If you currently plan to cook alone, maybe ask if someone else has the space for you to cook in the same place as them. On another note, sometimes when people say they will make some staple like mashed potatoes they're not planning to make the whole amount that's needed to feed 30-50 people. So definitely speak to the important dish-makers if you're still searching for a role. Preparing for this event may require you to talk to others on the team you may not have gotten the chance to know yet; In fact, that's a crucial part of the holiday.

.S Re: End Of Season Meeting
.M
I took some quick notes, so here they are for those who have forgotten or
weren't able to be there.....


*Pro*- Everyone agreed on the expectation that they need to show up even if
not playing. More explicit team communication about how many spots are
being held. Matty, Jibran and Marques said if they play pro, they would
still prioritize pro games over early season club events. Shank said he
would prioritize club over pro. Potentially Phoenix starts practicing
Yardley, but unsure the feasibility and need to see what happens with both
teams before trying to figure it out.

*Scheduling*: Jake, Bobby, Tristan volunteered to try to host a tourney at
the end of August. Jake has a contact for fields potentially.

Team would commit to a tourney over wildwood if the reps were good.
Team wants more tourneys, NY Invite, Pitt or Boston, Going to Philly
Classic, Chesapeake and hopefully our own or select flight etc.
Team agrees that starting tryouts later (mid to late May) is better and
returners have to show up. Need to work around pro schedule so they can at
least be there. commit to being at all tryouts for perceptions
Everyone was on board with a retreat weekend (grover looking into fields by
his house). Everyone loves doing stuff together, potentially going to fun
tourneys like Henlopen in the spring depending on how many people are doing
Pro and just having fun reps. Bo and Freshman both offered to host after
events near their respective houses for BBQ's. (MCUDL and Rutgers
respectively)

*Strategy* - Is there anyone else who can be an additional coach to help
take some burden from Eileen was brought up. or compartmentalize tasks
between eileen and grover more so they each can be more specialized.
- Everyone liked the structure for feedback and hope it facilitates more
feedback for higher end players.
- If there are skillsets that one player does really well and the team is
struggling AND it fits within the construct of the practice goal, set time
within practice (or extend practice to gain teh time) for them to teach
that particular skill. Not a free for all, but a time to allow a stronger
player work with everoyne on something that fits within the strcuture of
the system.
- Everyone likes the individual feedback spreadsheet sharing and the video
stuff
- An idea was thrown about getting Devyl or HS kids to come film our
practices and help grow them too. Tristan will look into this. Get better
footage earlier that way. They can upload, take that off of eileen.


Pods sometimes didn't work last year, why - Feedback was started too late
and leaders need to be people who can be there early. Too many late then
just didn't get the buy in. So start earlier and coordinate who will do it
better.

Regarding subbing- people didn't think pods with living locations would
gain as much chemistry (more just accountability) because the reps are
smaller scale and not full play, except for secoco mini etc. Everyone liked
the role pod idea but the general feel was that everyone needs not only a
parciular role, but also particular rules. ie can't throw certain things.
this will help control silly turns and motivate people to improve that
skill. People wanted a general idea of O and D still but understood the
benefits of both. People liked the structure of roles though overall.
Figured it could remove some of the issues of soft turns and
miscommunications.

Transparent about lines and tighter line situations and practice. Everyone
liked the format of our last regionals practice a lot and want more of
that. Put in certain situations with certain lines. Everyone knows that
means better commitment and accountability to be there and ready to go.

O/D Strategy-

General feel about the O line issues was that we were too dependant on our
bread and butter (flat hucks) so maybe rules in different scrims to take
away whatever is working well that day to force uncomfrotable situations.
The O line struggled getting to the secondary look when in Viper and split
stack in particular against poaches where the primary look was looked off.
Mostly a chemistry issue but the flow of secondary options felt forced.
Everyone agrees with Defensive thoughts in notes.

Knowing the rules and knowing HOW to react is important to improve. We get
taken advantage of due to our reactions and body language as much as our
lack of knowledge. Must know the correct rules, must react with silence
first then discuss knowing the facts. We are bad at both.

*Workout*- Game point. General buy in. Shank gave a good summary. Jesse
will run point to get it going.
Accountability, can we track peoples check off workouts in the app? Help
support each other mentally and help each other find the reason why we work
hard.


OTHER:

Bobby/Ben, Tristan Shank volunteered to help with the "program
coordination". Start a groupme for all of NJ ultimate slowly growing. Get
reps playing against rutgers at their turf practices. Maybe we can time our
practices in the summer to overlap an hour with Devyl to play against them
and then they can watch us. We want to foster a program and build others
up. It will help us now and in the long run.

Getting a coach for the B team would be very helpful. Dave Hsiung was
mentioned. or Belline after devyl.

Be positive to those who leave the team. They could come back. Some people
feel it's cliquey. Been always positive and friendly for everyone.

Team Contacts,

Chris and I are getting ready for the Club Working Group meeting at USAU HQ
in December, and we wanted to gather some feedback as we plan for the
meeting.

Please take a few minutes to fill out this survey (link
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFVM80mOogq420rQIy_gcVVa0VEQPAS605I_gJKtbXfwRB-g/viewform?fbclid=IwAR0X9XiBKSKuMJK_YuzboAd5ct48xL2DHtXktyOMAHr8G8wCb6xTTl-uWR4>)
and share it with the rest of your team. We are still trying to build the
FB group so we can share things directly with players, so I encourage
everyone to join us there as well (link
<https://www.facebook.com/groups/379352369066874/>).

If you have any feedback that doesn't really fit any of the questions, feel
free to reach out to us at clubmensrep@usaultimate.org.

Thanks,
Andrew Francis

.M
Gentlemen and Ladies,

Frisbee Thanksgiving will be held on Saturday, December 1st at 7:30pm in
the AMR I MPR.

The quick details are:
What: Bountiful home cooked food and drinks
Where: AMR I MPR
When: 7:30pm
Who: Anyone who has come to even one practice
*Important Note*: Sign up to cook or bring something here
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SVJyBmwYMWeVedOO2S8TZUNAC0KCHwid9ZGgImmJK-0/edit?usp=sharing>.
For details on what you should bring, please read the end of this email but
some necessities have been listed in on the google sheet. *Since it is in
the AMR I MPR, everybody MUST RSVP by Wednesday, November 28th! Do this by
texting your name to 734-516-8577 or by emailing your name to
jhudangerzone@gmail.com <jhudangerzone@gmail.com>*

Hope to see you there!

JHU Men's Ultimate

A more proper frisbee thanksgiving description is provided below by our
late friend Graham Smith

First thing's first, *everyone who is going is expected to contribute in
some way*. Ideally, your contribution should have a *perceived value of $15
at minimum*. Here
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SVJyBmwYMWeVedOO2S8TZUNAC0KCHwid9ZGgImmJK-0/edit?usp=sharing>
is
the link to the contribution spreadsheet, *add yourself so we don't have 4
people making the same thing unknowingly *(I got burned one year picking up
the slack that wasn't actually there, it sucks) .

*If you are either not on this spreadsheet or are all like "I don't know
what to do", this email is for you. READ IT.*



*Option negative 1) *Do not bring FFC food or some shit. Stealing is not in
the spirit of giving. Common freshman mistake. You also wouldn't be
contributing anything from yourself while your captains are spending lots
of time and money on turkeys for us.



*Option 1) * One easy thing we need every year is *food accessories*:
Napkins, plasticware, plates, cups. Maybe some condiments like salt/pepper.
Incredibly easy, yet an essential contribution. Note: $15-20 dollars can
buy you a lot of what we need, so we probably need 1-2 people on this tops. *If
you plan to do this, make sure it's on the spreadsheet.*



*Option 2)  **Make something* (*where I mean "make" loosely*)! If you don't
cook, some shit can be easy enough to learn in one go on the web. We've
used Cooking for Engineers in the past. It's even easier to *buy a bunch of
dinner rolls or cornbread and put it on a big platter* (We legitimately
need someone to do these, sign up). Good vegetables are often
underrepresented, and how much easier can you get than carrots or
broccoli or some shit? Also note you don't need to bring something
"traditional". Do you make a mean/special grilled cheese? Or does your
family always buy a few cans of pearled onions that apparently other
families don't do (<-me)? Go for it.



*Option 3) **Become somebody's helper/duplicate.* If someone else seems to
be making a dish that may have a high time or monetary buy-in, ask if they
want help. Help out in the kitchen, and give some cash. Maybe learn a
senior's signature dish so it can be here next year. In my opinion, cooking
alone is the wrong approach to Frisbee Thanksgiving, company is much more
fun. If you currently plan to cook alone, maybe ask if someone else has the
space for you to cook in the same place as them. On another note, sometimes
when people say they will make some staple like mashed potatoes they're
not planning to make the whole amount that's needed to feed 30-50
people. So definitely speak to the important dish-makers if you're still
searching for a role. Preparing for this event may require you to talk to
others on the team you may not have gotten the chance to know yet; In
fact, that's a crucial part of the holiday.





*Other info:*


   - *If you need to hit a grocery store for whatever reason, there are
   many cars on the team, and many of their owners are probably gonna be
   making trips already, so communicate -- send emails to the list with wild
   abandon. Cars for transporting food to the venue on Saturday may be in
   higher demand, please figure it out.*
   - *Dinner is at 7:30 Saturday Dec. 1st in the AMR I Multipurpose Room.
   You do NOT want to be late, be sure you're done cooking in time.*
   - *There's a second tab of the spreadsheet dedicated to helping. It
   would be lovely if those of you whose current job is over once you're
   handed a receipt also offered some form of help to somebody, even if it's
   just with something like carrying rather than cooking.*
   - *I fucking ASSUME there will be partying afterwards to look forward
   to, otherwise I refuse to be a part of this team in the Spring.*
   - *If I forgot anything or messed up somewhere, chime in.*

.S Re: End Of Season Meeting
.M
Wanted to share an agenda put together by Grover and Eileen, some of the
topics they touched upon from their meeting and good starting points for
our meeting. Take a look and come prepared with your own thoughts and
questions and ideas.

GSU Planning Agenda

Nov 18th 2018



1- Pro Club Interaction/Expectation

-Expectation of coming to practices and tryouts if games don’t directly
conflict. Too many missing last year. If players can’t play but the time
doesn’t conflict, still show up. Be a part of the team.

- Roster transparency regarding how many spots committed to and being held.
Communication to individuals was done last year, but not clearly to
everyone.

- Eileen's status with Pro

- How to improve practice if there’s a pro game, prioritizing tourney or pro

- If a lot of people are doing pro, commit even as a practice player so we
get reps together

- Thoughts and Input? Who’s planning to do what?

2- Scheduling

   -

   Tournaments- Grover will discuss the situation. If we want more reps,
   Boston and Pitt?, do we want more low level tourneys vs practice? Host our
   own and recruit?
   -

   Team Events- Need a retreat weekend
   -

   Practices- Format and length on average from feedback was good.
   -

      In order to have more scrimmage/mini based practices, to focus on
      creating game situations, people must have individual
accountability to do
      drills in pods and work to improve the skills needed to improve the
      scrimmages
      -

   Ideas and Volunteers?


3- Strategy and Feedback

   -

   Comment about individualized Feedback
   -

      Coaches had a spreadsheet we filled in after every tournament for
      individual feedback so that we could give it to those who wanted. We can
      just make this public next year.
      -

      Video and review- We can better with this with the spreadsheet and
      more film late in the season. We need to do it all the time and everyone
      has to buy in. If you want more feedback, putting in the work of adding
      your own comments and questions helps facilitate the feedback
      -

      Individualized feedback takes a ton of time and effort. It takes a
      village.
      -

         Consider having each captain have a group of players that they
         help facilitate individual feedback, check in with each other
and help be
         there
         -

   Subbing comments
   -

      Subbing can absolutely improve. Two Ideas to consider instead of the
      3 line structure currently (to potentially get away from the O D
mentality)
      -

         Create a Pod Structure based on role and then rotate X number from
         within that role (pods of cutters, pods of center handlers, pods of
         distributor handlers etc; based on what Matty does with Fury).
         -

            Pros- this gives everyone a set role on the field
            -

            Cons- leaves less room for chemistry and improvisation
            -

         Create a Pod Structure based on Living locations.
         -

            Pros- Lines can build chemistry, accountability of workouts,
            and each line can have unique tactics
            -

            Cons- Requires buy in so everyone puts in the work to get the
            chemistry.
            -

      Any other subbing suggestions? We know if can improve and want more
      ideas.
      -

   Offense
   -

      From feedback and rewatching film
      -

         Need to be more aggressive throwing downfield
         -

         Most reset turns are on discs going backwards and leads to
         opponent fast breaks. Must dedicate to the system of forward
resetting and
         resets have to commit to setting up to facilitate
         -

         If back, MUST get the swing and continue. No Dancing.
         -

         Majority of turns were soft. This is an execution problem that
         needs individual accountability. Hopefully the earlier
playbook will remove
         communication issues, but everyone needs to hold themselves
to a higher
         standard on turnovers. Remember, 1 turn per person per game
is 189 turns in
         a weekend and 27 turns per game. No team will win like that.
         -

         Fakes and pivoting - not done with a purpose, and therefore
         frequently at the wrong time; especially true with younger
throwers - would
         be better to just stand still until ready to throw
         -

            Only fake/pivot to communicate and do it with a purpose
            -

               Move mark
               -

               Communicate to cutter
               -

               Move defender/poachers
               -

               Set up next throw
               -

         Cut timing - people were waiting until person catches and then
         decide to cut (due to lack of trust in system/handlers); need to have
         better timing, but also throwers need to help this by turning
and throwing
         - want this to be THE focus of early season (this coupled with the
         fakes/pivoting - basically do triangle of death and marking
drill every
         practice)
         -

      We need to double down on plays and structure. We have been building
      the playbook and sent it out late in the year last year. We will continue
      to build it and will send it out earlier.
      -

      Any other thoughts about Offense?
      -

   Defense
   -

      The past couple years we’ve had a spreadsheet with all the teams we
      play, their team strategy, and particular players and matches we want to
      see. We can build more and make this public. Anyone with more
contributions
      can help provide it early so it can be combined and given out
      -

      Must improve
      -

         Crumble from zone
         -

         Marking - needs to be much more active; we are easily broken
         because people are mostly flat footed and upright
         -

         Switching and poaching defensive looks
         -

      Any other Defensive thoughts?
      -

   General
   -

      Being too nice - we are literally the only team that calls our own
      fouls and lets others dictate the flow of the game; we need to be tougher
      and more certain of the rules so we can make confident calls; also,
      everyone needs to follow the play so we have others to back up
(especially
      in/out calls when we don't have observers)
      -

      Recruiting- It is everyone’s responsibility to recruit and we all
      have to be proactive. If you think someone else will do a good
job, or you
      want to talk about how to do it, ask.
      -

      Individual accountability. We need to continue to improve pushing
      ourselves, making the sacrifices and showing each other that we are doing
      so. It’s an important life skill. How can we help improve this?
      -

      Any other feedback?

4. Workouts

   1.

   Team needs to decide and commit
   1.

      Options - UAP or Game Point Performance
      2.

   Being better about managing time and working on mental game
   1.

      Recognize that we all put a lot of pressure on ourselves.
      2.

      What can we do to be better at supporting each other?



5- Leadership

   -

   Nominations for people (think about if you’d be willing to do it)
   -

   Blind Vote



6- Volunteers to champion important planning

    A- Tournament Planning

    B- Practice Field Site Coordination (insurance with USAU)

    C- Fundraising

    D- Social stuff and Tune Up Coordination

    E - Workout coordination with Game Point/UAP

.S Schedule for the final project presentations
.M
The schedule for the final project presentations is posted on the course
web page:
http://mt-class.org/jhu/project.html

Your presentations should include
- summary of the project idea
- motivation why this is an interesting project to work on
- core method
- evaluation method / metric
- details of technical execution
- data sets used
- experimental results
- findings

Since the presentation is well before the deadline of the project, you may
not have any results yet, or even some aspects of your method worked out.
That is fine. View this presentation as a opportunity to get feedback and
organize your work.

Since the first presentation day is just after Thanksgiving, I scheduled
all the single-person project then. If you do not think you could possibly
present that day, please email me and I will reschedule you. However,
please try to make an effort.

Important: Attendance in the class has been lower in recent lectures (and
that is fine) but please support your fellow students and attend their
project presentations.

.S EN.601.640.01.FA18 Web Security: Inlined javascript monitor using getters/setters
.M
Hello,

I am part of the team that is working on the final project for inlined javascript monitor. I'm not sure how far you have personally looked into the issue, but we are having trouble in some regards. There is the idea of explicit information flow, and implicit information flow. And getters and setters can be used to understand explicit information flow for sure, but the paper we were given as well as other papers in the field use many other techniques to try to identify and stop implicit flows. We were tasked to create a prototype using getters and setters, but our solutions seem like they will only be partially correct. Do you have any advice or ideas for how we can proceed? Or any clarifications of what exactly you expect from us going into the final presentation?

Thank you,
Angelo

Thank you!

Subject: Fall 2018 Graduation Forms

** Please READ all my instructions to complete this process correctly**

Greetings, it’s getting close to the end!!!

For those of you who have completed a Fall 2018 Graduation Application with the Registrar and intend to graduate with your CS MSE this semester, I’ve attached the documents required for your degree conferral.
They include:

1.)    MSE Computer Science Advising Worksheet – Due Friday, 11/30/18
2.)    WSE Masters Completion Confirmation – Due Friday, 11/30/18
3.)    *Qualifying Project Form (QPF) (only required if you are doing a project/thesis) – Due Friday, 12/07/18
4.)    * Responsible Conduct of Research Training (only required if you are doing a project/thesis) – Due Friday, 12/07/18



Important Notes:



1.       Do not submit any handwritten documents (only signatures can be handwritten on emailed forms).

All documents have to be submitted to me via email only.



2.       The department will verify all Fall 2018 grades, so leave the grade section for those courses blank. In other words, it’s totally fine to submit the advising sheet without Fall 18 course grades. If you have earned or are earning another degree at JHU and are double counting 2 classes, mark them with a DC next to the grade.



3.       Your advising worksheet and QPF can be hand or electronically signed by your advisor.



4.       I do not need the project report, just the QPF.



5.       Complete and submit the student section of the WSE Master’s and CAS Completion Confirmation.



6.       The RCR training link is below, and I’ve attached an example of the completion form that you’ll need to send me after finishing the training.

.S EN.500.603.01.FA18 Academic Ethics: Now Available for Completion: Mandatory EN.500.603 Academic Ethics
.M
Happy Fall 2018 Semester!
You may have noticed that a class you did not register for yourself is on your registration: EN. 500.603 Academic Ethics. This is a WSE  requirement: https://engineering.jhu.edu/graduate-studies/academic-policies-procedures-graduate/
All new Engineering graduate students are automatically enrolled in this course. It is a pass/fail online course entitled “Academic Ethics (EN.500.603)”. You must successfully complete the tutorial and quiz by the end of your first semester in the graduate program. If you do so, you will receive a grade of “P” for the course. If you do not complete the tutorial and quiz during the stated time frame, you will receive a irreversible grade of “F” for the course, and your registration for the following semester will be blocked. If you  are taking this in a later semester due to extenuating circumstances and don't meet the timeline for completion, you may be delayed in or prohibited from receiving your degree or diploma.
The course will be open starting at 3:00pm today (November 28, 2018) and will remain open until the end of the day on December 21, 2018.  It is a 20 minute module.
I will be checking to see course completions on the following date: December 21, 2018 (last day of exams in the Fall 2018 semester).  
A little bit about the course:
The Whiting School of Engineering is committed to fostering a community that values high ethical standards.  The Dean's Office created this 20-minute tutorial to educate graduate students about their academic and ethical responsibilities. We ask that you pay careful attention to this tutorial and make sure you understand all the material in it, including additional resources available to you.  By observing the guidelines presented in this tutorial you can ensure the integrity of your scholarship. At the end of the tutorial you will be asked to complete a short four-question quiz.  By the end of this training program you will be able to describe the following:
1. Common forms of misconduct
2. Resources to help you understand your responsibilities

Please log into your Blackboard account through your my.jh.edu portal to see this course activated and ready for you to begin.
Do let me know if you experience any technical difficulties or have any questions (special tip- the videos seem to run better in Internet Explorer than in Firefox or Chrome for some reason- check your plug-ins if you want to use Firefox, or try different browsers!).
Have a wonderful week!

.S Young Lives, Best Night
.M
Dear Dangerbrothers,



Start your engines, mark your calendars, and start edging because Friday
12/7 is a most auspicious night. The best night of many humans’ young
lives. A night of many somersaults, rock paper scissorses, and other
associated games of wit.


*FFN BOIIIIIIIII*


This is a MANDATORY event for all members of the squa, especially rookies*,
so your presence will be expected unless you have an incredibly valid
excuse. Any other plans you have for that night are now irrelevant. Nothing
matters but young lives and best nights. Brace for impact


Stay on the lookout for more deets. Rooks, text me if you are lactose
intolerant, have food allergies, or prefer to not partake in adult
beverages ((207)776-1138).


Strap on your kneepads,

Lando


P.S. Winkler, you’re fucked.

.S Re: Roles. Updated Oline cutter 4, some bullets on general defensive line + Handler Defenders, Added Defensive offense
.M
Reset Handler:
add something about being a leader in the stack, maybe like "you are the
anchor of the stack, your job is to make sure all the cutters are in the
right position at all times. Do so by being vocal and assertive"

All cutters:
add reliable hands

Handler defenders:
add something about how the role of the handler defenders is to fuck up the
offense as much as possible by doing a lot of little things very well in
the backfield, thereby causing turns downfield.

.S Faculty Meeting Summary 11/13
.D Thu, 15 Nov 2018 15:45:36 +0000
.M
Hi all, here's the notes from the most recent faculty meeting. As always, let us (Eli Sherman and myself) know if you have any questions or comments.

Rachel and Eli


Short version:

  *   Reimbursements need to be sent to CS_JHUISI_HELP@jhu.edu<mailto:CS_JHUISI_HELP@jhu.edu> within 90 days
  *   Undergrad town hall happened recently, department will look into suggestions brought up by undergrads such as getting more CA/TA support, and if it might be possible to have some things more standardized across courses

Long version:

New CS Staff
We have a new Senior Academic Coordinator, Kelly Culotta. She'll be working with the undergrads/on undergraduate programs.

Undergrad advising

  *   Advising of undergrads needs improvement in our department.
  *   Concretely, advisors need to be sure they respond to advisee emails and meet with their advisees.
  *   To help make the advising process smoother, Kelly Culotta will be reviewing advising forms before students meet with their advisor. She and Joanne will get all advising related emails from undergrads at advising@cs.jhu.edu<mailto:advising@cs.jhu.edu>, and might also create a Piazza for advising for the undergrads.

Reimbursements

  *   Reimbursements and questions need to go to CS_JHUISI_HELP@jhu.edu<mailto:CS_JHUISI_HELP@jhu.edu>
  *   Must be within 90 days -- this is an IRS requirement
  *   Students should get pre-approval from their advisor via email, and then the email can just be forwarded to CS_JHUISI_HELP@jhu.edu<mailto:CS_JHUISI_HELP@jhu.edu> when reimbursement is submitted.

Undergrad town hall

Topics brought up by the undergrads included:

  *   Course quality
  *   Prof and TA/CA accessibility, and need for more TAs/CAs
  *   Desire for smaller classes
  *   Desire to be more able to get into classes
  *   Students would prefer if the same class offered different semesters was at least somewhat standardized, particularly in regards to workload
  *   Students like "late day" systems, would like late days across CS classes, rather than decided on a per class basis

Updates from Dean Schlessinger

  *   CS largest undergraduate major
  *   For the most part (though not entirely), money for faculty hiring need to go instead to infrastructure/space for the time being
  *   There are slightly more grad students than undergrads
  *   Undergrads are academically, the strongest Hopkins has ever had -- average 3.95 GPA for incoming freshman, and average 1535/1600 SAT score
  *   Hopkins now owns the Steiff Silver building and material characterization and processing planned for Steiff
  *   Wyman park building renovation might take some pressure off CS once it's finished
  *   Question to the Dean about the future of the Computer Engineering program administered by CS and ECE -- what is the future of the program? Up to CS and ECE how this is handled.
  *   43% women in incoming class, URM higher than ever as well
  *   Hopkins doesn't grade on a curve overall. This is good because the students admitted are a skewed distribution to start with so grades shouldn't be normally distributed. Hopkins would like to make a statement to this effect -- need to make sure this is true across the board in every department and will be checking in with Department Chairs.
  *   The Dean knows size and space are major issues for CS -- they're working on it best they can
  *
Prioritizing space for now to alleviate large class issues; feasibility studies being started for possible down-the-road infrastructure projects
  *
JHU CS is now one of the largest private-school departments in the country, as is WSE

Hiring

  *   Department Head search is still ongoing
  *   Planning to hire 2 teaching faculty this year

Danger Brothers,


We’re over half way done with the semester and had our first tourney. I know a lot of people are buying their plane tickets soon to go home for winter break. For Freshmen, our winter break is 6 weeks and has two 3 week parts: regular winter break and intersession. Most schools only have 3 weeks of winter break, so usually most of your home friends are back at school during intersession, meaning it is boring to be at home. Then what should you do during intersession instead of being bored at home? During intersession, Hopkins offers some free courses for students and students sometimes come back for research or come back just to hang out with friends and party. Courses for intersession are already available here: https://summerprograms.jhu.edu/program/intersession-program/intersession-courses/. There are 1, 2 and 3 week courses and registration opens on December 4.


A great way to get better at frisbee is to be at Hopkins over intersession. I reached out to a couple people on the team, and we already have over 8 guys committed to being here for at least 2 of the 3 weeks of intersession, which means at least 2 weeks of uninterrupted frisbee time where we can hold mini practices, throw, run drills, play mini, and bond with your danger brothers.


Feel free to ask me or any other upperclassman if you have any questions about intersession and/or how it works.


I urge you to be here over intersession; it’s a huge step towards our goals as a team. It is a sacrifice to not being home and not seeing your friends, but it is going to make the difference between us and the other teams at regionals this year. Every single day and every single throw counts for us. We have to outwork

our opponents every step of the way this year, and two weeks of nonstop frisbee would be huge.

Hey Duck,

I'm gonna provide some quick structure for our team lifting sessions. If
you already have a program you're following like Morrill or something, keep
doing that. This is for anyone that doesn't have a structure. In the near
future, Nick Simonelli will be helping out to create something we can do as
a team that will benefit us most at this point in the season. Until then we
can stick with this base.

*Day 1:*

Hang Clean 3x5 or Deadlift Trap Bar Jump 3x5 (if you don't know how to hang
clean)
Single Leg Shoulder Elevated Glute Bridge 10 second hold + 10 reps each leg
Straight Leg Sit Up 3x10


Rear Foot Elevated Single Leg Squat 3x5
Split Squat Switch Jump 3x2 each leg (start in a lunge, two quick scissor
jumps, end with the same leg forward, reset)
Push Ups 3x8 (add weight on your back)

Single Leg Deadlift w/ Dumbbell 3x8 each leg
Chin Up 3x5 (add weight or do pull ups)
Standing Anti-Rotation Hold 30 seconds x3 each side (or side plank for 45
seconds each side)

*Day 2:*

Kettlebell Swing 3x8
Broad Jump (or single leg broad jump if you want to do that) 3x3 (each)
Hollow Hold 30 seconds x3

Bench Press (any variation) 3x5
Row (any variation) 3x5
Feet Elevated Side Plank 45 seconds x3 each side

Single Leg Squat 3x5 (1 leg in air extended in front of you, squat down to
a bench)
YTW 3x6 each (hold 2.5-5 lb weight plate in each hand, can do this bent
over or on an angled bench)
Hanging Leg Raise 3x10


So this is a rough plan for the next two days. It's gonna be hard to fit
all of us in that gym and get these things done together. We should have
some of us start on that first day and some on the second. Come ask me if
you don't know how to do something or if the equipment for that lift is
taken and I can give you a replacement lift.


As I said, I will most likely be sending out something better for us to
work on as a team as I work with Nick, but I just whipped this up quick
with some of the stuff Charlie and I have been working on so we have some
structure tonight. *Remember to roll out and stretch a bit to warm up
before lifting*.

Dooby

.S DZRising Throwing Challenge
.M
Danger Brothers,


I am really happy with how focused we were throughout practice last night
it was a nice turnaround from this weekend. We ran the same up-line drill
for over an hour, and we continued cutting hard and threw every disc with
an intent on improving. But, one thing that surprised me at the beginning
of practice was when Angelo was reading off the number of players who
leadership thought could throw an up-line, an around, a huck, etc. None of
those criteria had more than half of our team. At this very moment, we are
far away from our team goal to make nationals.


How much do you love our team? How bad do you want to make it to fucking
nationals? Enough to spend 30 min to throw every day? The number that
really stood out to me yesterday was that leadership thought that only 3
people would even attempt Gabe's throwing challenge. We can still reach our
goal with a lot of desire. If you are hungry enough, you can commit at
least 30 minutes every day to getting better at throwing. One of my new
personal goals/expectations for myself as a Danger Brother is to throw
every single day until the last day of school of this school year in May.
But, I can't achieve this goal on my own, I need my brothers to throw with
me, to spend 30 minutes every day with me, to be my teammates and my
family, to be hungry with me, to want to go to Natties with me. And I
challenge everyone, from the rookies who have never thrown a disc before a
couple months ago to the veterans who have been playing high school or club
to join me on this challenge. If we can get our whole team to commit to
throwing every day, we can get a lot better very fast. All it takes is 30
minutes. There will be a disc in my backpack for the rest of the year and
you can expect many throwing selfies for the rest of the year.


DZRising,

Chris

Not convinced yet? See what others are saying!

We understand if this seems like just another company's insincere sales pitch, so why don't we let our customers do the talking for us?

"We have been with VC Ultimate for the past several years and are very happy with it! They’re always very cooperative and extremely easy to communicate with. They will always tell us what they have to offer and what they expect of us, so there are no surprises. Thanks for working with us VC Ultimate! We make a great team!"

"VC has an incredible knack for interpreting the vision of a team (often expressed in random unfinished sentences and blurry pictures from the internet) into a strong logo. They captured exactly what we were looking for in a logo and uniform set, and the image has become a bit of a brand for our women's development work in our corner of Ontario.

"Speedy delivery of some discs we ordered for prizes for our upcoming high school tourney...please do not fire the awesome employee who slipped us a bonus disc and the thoughtful note. Thanks VC for all you do to support grass roots ultimate."

Introducing: Our Men's Regular Cut

Over the last year, we've gotten a ton of feedback that our men's shorts were too long.  We agree -- so we've trimmed a full 3 inches off our Men's shorts.  We think that most people will prefer our new shorter cut, but if you like the longer version, don't despair -- we'll still have it available as our new Men's Long cut.

We now have 5 shorts options for you (all are available for team orders):

Women's Regular

Men's Regular

Men's Long

Women's Racer

Men's Racer

And each one is available in our amazing lightweight and water repellent microfiber fabric.

For more information or to ask for a sample pair to try out, contact your favorite Spin person:

Are you still open to new job opportunities?

2 recruiters are waiting to hear from you.

Respond to InMail https://www.linkedin.com/comm/messaging/?filter=inmail&midToken=AQF-BWzQ9cWIeQ&trk=eml-email_jobs_open_candidates_inmails_ignored_single_01-inmail-0-nonresponse_oc_click&trkEmail=eml-email_jobs_open_candidates_inmails_ignored_single_01-inmail-0-nonresponse_oc_click-null-8nacrj%7Ejfvk0db5%7Ek7-null-messaging%7Emain&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Aemail_email_jobs_open_candidates_inmails_ignored_single_01%3BDAxiuvIvQpK3ECuZPWcsfQ%3D%3D

You are currently letting recruiters know that you’re open to new opportunities. Responding (even with a "no thank you") lets recruiters know you’re still looking and increases your chances of getting new opportunities. If you don’t respond to these messages within the next 7 days, we will stop letting recruiters know that you’re open.

We're updating our Terms of Service and wanted to give you an overview of some of what's new. These changes impact our User Agreement, Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy and Professional Community Policies and are effective May 8, 2018. Anytime we make updates, we hope to make it easy for you to understand your choices and the control you have over your data and content on LinkedIn.

Check out my blog post for full details. Here's some of what's new:

* We make it even easier to understand the data we have about you, how you can correct it and how you can ask us to stop using it.

* Our new settings give you more control over ads you see and more transparency about the data shared with advertisers.

* Refreshed community policies make sure LinkedIn stays a platform where people act professionally. Built from our well-established community guidelines, these policies encourage discussions that can help our members be more productive and successful, and outline what activity may be stopped by LinkedIn.

* * For example, harassment and hate speech are not welcome on our platform and could result in permanent restriction from LinkedIn.

* * Also, if you are being paid to share or endorse a product or service, you need to disclose that you're being paid for your opinions or actions.

Your privacy comes first in all of these updates. We now meet the high standard for data privacy introduced by the new European data protection law known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which goes into effect later in May. LinkedIn members around the world will benefit from many of these changes. To learn more, check out our GDPR Help Center.

If for any reason you don't agree to our new terms and would rather close your account than opt out of specific new features, you can do so.

Thanks for being a member,

Sara Harrington, Vice President of Legal at LinkedIn

Hello Angelo,

This message is from a local disc player who is building a disc golf course for his Eagle Scout project.  Information on how to support the project is included below.  Happy Thanksgiving everyone!

Hi! My name is Greg Winkelstern, an Eagle Scout candidate. I live in New Milford, CT, I am a high school senior, and I am 17 years old. For my Eagle Scout Project, I will be installing a disc golf course at Clatter Valley Park in New Milford CT. The course will have 9 holes. There will be beginner and advanced level tee pads. There will also be a 10th open basket for practice and games. Attached at the bottom is a very rough idea of what the course may look like. This may alter or even change completely.

My Eagle Scout Project is up and running and I want you to be a part of it! Whether you live in Connecticut or not I need your help to like, follow, share, and get involved with this project. While I work to install this disc golf course I intend to educate and excite people everywhere about this incredible sport! This is my passion and I bet it's yours too! Please take a look at my project pages:
